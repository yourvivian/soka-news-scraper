Students can enroll in any Learning Cluster course regardless of their declared concentration, which means the winter block courses can bring together students engaged in biomedical research, students training to become multidisciplinary storytellers, and students hoping to work at the United Nations. What unites Soka students across concentrations is their shared commitment to the university’s mission of becoming global citizens who lead contributive lives. On February 1, students from 29 Learning Cluster courses shared their research and experiences at the annual Learning Cluster Fair sponsored by Academic Affairs. Enjoy these highlights from their work and the fair. During “The Holocaust and America,” 11 students and Professor Robert Allinson studied the tragic history of the Holocaust and the enduring legacy of anti-Judaism. The course critically engaged with the work of noted scholar, journalist, author, and political philosopher Hannah Arendt as she grappled with the trial of Adolf Eichmann, the “Architect of the Holocaust.” In addition to engaging with challenging readings and documentary films, the class visited the Holocaust Museum LA and the Museum of Tolerance. They also had the opportunity to bear witness to Eva Perlman’s life story of surviving the Holocaust as a young girl. Hearing the experience of someone who survived such trauma at a young age deeply moved the students and humanized the painful history they’d studied throughout the course. Reflecting on their experience in Prof. Allinson’s Learning Cluster, one student said, “I think that this course and similar courses should be taught to all college students. It’s good to face the evils in history to further develop our character and morals.” In “Science and Theatre,” students met with industry professionals and thought leaders who shared their knowledge of Broadway, improvisation, puppetry, and scriptwriting in a series of workshops and guest lectures. They researched scientific topics of interest in parallel to deepen their scientific knowledge, and went on field trips to enrich experience and insight. Their studies culminated in drafting scripts, four of which were selected and performed for the SUA student body on the last day of the course. “Theater is my passion, and I have often used it as a means to introduce scientific concepts in a more humanistic, relatable manner,” said Susan Walsh, associate professor of molecular/cellular biology. • Contributing Through Education • The Holocaust and America • Self-Government in Wales • The Politics of Disneyland • Period Poverty and Stigma • Traditional Medicine • Nuclear Disarmament/Nobel Peace • Being Human in STEM • Dark Tourism Abandoned People • English/Japanese Translation • Leadership & Followership • Genetic Engineering • Machine Learning • Japanese Language and Society", "categories": ["Undergraduate Academics", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "March 30, 2023", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

The festival, open to everyone, will feature musical performances from contemporary artists, delicious food and drink, and family activities from balloon animals to inflatable slides. The free, day-long event on May 6 also marks the anniversary of SUA’s dedication. “This will be an event that brings together our campus and local communities to celebrate our founding and mark the anniversary of SUA’s dedication, showcase the beauty of our location, and reestablish SUA as a vital gathering space,” SUA President Edward Feasel said. Grammy-nominated singer and songwriter Gaby Moreno, a native of Guatemala who now lives in Los Angeles, will headline an exciting, multicultural lineup of artists performing at the festival, which includes the sounds of Latin America, New Orleans jazz, pop and dance music, and contemporary hits. Moreno has released five albums and earned a 2017 Grammy nomination for her album “Illusion.” She received an Emmy nomination for co-writing the “Parks & Recreation” theme song, and won a Latin Grammy for Best New Artist in 2013. In 2006, Moreno was awarded the Grand Prize in the John Lennon Songwriting Contest and is now one of the contest’s judges. She also sings the theme song and is the voice of Marlena on the award-winning children’s television series, “Elena of Avalor,” which features Disney’s first Latina princess. Rounding out the day’s lineup are alternative pop duo Neil Frances, a music festival favorite that recently completed a string of sold-out shows on the West Coast; classically trained pianist, queer-femme producer, singer-songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist Biianco; Jazzy Ash, vocalist, writer, arts educator, and founder of Leaping Lizards Music, a music and theater education program for students; and the Nandos, who will perform both new original music and recognizable top 40 hits from many genres and eras. Festival-goers will have plenty of choices of what to eat and drink while enjoying the music. A variety of food trucks will showcase foods from different international cuisines, and a selection of local and international brews and vintages will be available in a 5,000-square-foot beer and wine garden. The festival will build on the incredible success of the International Festival. That festival was paused during the pandemic after being held for the first 18 years after the founding of the Aliso Viejo campus in 2001.

Beginning Fall 2023, the Soka Opportunity Plan will ensure tuition is covered by grants and scholarships for students whose families have annual incomes below $90,000 and demonstrated financial need. Those students may also qualify for additional gift aid to reduce or eliminate education-related costs, such as living expenses, books, and transportation. Previously, the university covered full tuition for students with family incomes below $60,000. SUA will also provide generous need-based aid packages to students whose household income is greater than $90,000. In addition, every admitted student will receive a merit scholarship. Students who have demonstrated exceptional academic achievements may receive additional merit-based scholarships. “The Soka Opportunity Plan demonstrates our dedication to educating global citizens regardless of a family’s financial circumstances,” said Soka University of America President Edward Feasel. “We understand the barriers many students face in the pursuit of higher education, and are committed to partnering with families to help ensure our nationally ranked liberal arts education is affordable for all students attending SUA.” Since its first undergraduate class arrived on SUA’s Aliso Viejo campus in 2001, the university has been committed to opening its doors to qualified students regardless of their financial circumstances through a need-blind admission process. In the 2022-2023 academic year, 100% of enrolled students received a merit scholarship, and approximately 70% received grants and scholarships that exceeded tuition to help cover other academic-related expenses. SUA’s tuition for the 2023-24 academic year will be $34,382, with total direct expenses, including living on campus and a semester of study abroad, of $48,274.

We spoke to Prof. Levenson about the grant, his research, and his hopes for SUA students, among other things. Congratulations on being the first SUA faculty member to win a National Science Foundation grant! Tell us about the research this grant will fund. The research funded by this grant explores the molecular basis of the tunable assembly of reflectin proteins, which are a unique family of proteins found in squid and other cephalopods such as octopus and cuttlefish. The reflectins play a central role in creating dynamic iridescent structures within squid skin, which the squid use to communicate with others within their species and as camouflage from predators. The reflectin proteins are found within a series of densely filled, parallel plates called lamellae. Some squid can control the extent of reflectin assembly within these lamellae, which results in changes to the amount and color of the light that bounces from the reflective structures. Bioengineering and material scientists have been interested in reflectins as a model biomaterial for application in bioelectronics or biophotonics ever since their discovery in 2004. That sounds fascinating. How will your research build on previous studies? Many questions remain about what physical forces drive reflectin proteins to change their assembly because of cell signals. The behavior of any protein is determined by its amino acid sequence, which is the unique order of amino acid building blocks that make up a protein. This NSF-funded work seeks to better understand how reflectins are able to undergo dynamic and tunable assembly within squid and to leverage this understanding to produce new reflectin proteins with improved biomaterial utility. Working together with Soka students, we will use genetic engineering methods to create new reflectins that will enable us to untangle the role of particular amino acid sequences found in reflectins with the protein’s behavior. We will characterize the activity of these proteins using biophysical instruments here at Soka and at other research institutions. In deep collaboration with Prof. Susan Walsh, we are already producing reflectin proteins with human HeLa cancer cells to investigate their behavior in complex cellular environments. How do you think it might benefit students at SUA? This support from the NSF will provide critical support to greatly expand my lab’s capacity to conduct impactful research on the molecular basis of reflectin assembly in squid. It will enable us to purchase critical cutting-edge laboratory equipment and to fund additional student researcher positions in the lab, providing increased opportunities for students to engage in the high-impact practice of undergraduate research. Some of these students will be able to attend scientific conferences nationwide. The grant will also support the creation of a new course-based undergraduate research experience focused on the research goals of the grant, which will join the diverse collection of project-based labs already offered at Soka in disciplines such as chemistry, cell biology, and genetics. How did you discover your passion for science in general and your field in particular? I discovered my passion for science in general in high school when I read the writings of the astronomer and science communicator Carl Sagan. Sagan talked about science as a way of logical thinking that appealed to me. I have always wanted to understand more of the how and why of the world. While I think there is insight and beauty in many modes of understanding, the particular approach of the sciences, based on logical and systematic thinking grounded in evidence, fits my natural mindset best. I fell into my specific field somewhat by chance. I considered several potential majors as an undergraduate. In the end, biochemistry won out mainly because I was fascinated by proteins, those “work horses” of the cell. Without proteins, there is no life, at least in its modern form. As a student, I felt that by learning about proteins and, more broadly, the varied molecules of life, I was gaining true insight into the fundamental basis of life. I still believe this! I went to graduate school to learn more about the structures of proteins and how they work, and my fascination with them in all their varied forms continues to this day. Borrowing the line from Charles Darwin, proteins have a wondrous diversity that gives them “endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful.” Medicinal and biotechnological applications of what scientists are learning about proteins are already improving the world and will continue to do so long into the future. What role do you think the Life Sciences plays in actualizing SUA’s mission of educating global citizens who lead contributive lives? Science—both its practice and its products in the form of theories and technologies—holds an inescapable central role in modern society. I believe contributive citizens must understand how science works and have some amount of foundational knowledge of key concepts within the scientific fields. The Life Sciences concentration provides this form of teaching of science knowledge and practice through its classrooms and laboratories, including a future course-based undergraduate research experience central to my research supported by this NSF grant. It is also vital that students develop an understanding of how science connects with the broader aspects of our lives outside of the textbook and lab. Effective communication of science to the general public is a critical need as the world seeks evidence-based solutions to global problems. The type of communication that speaks to scientists and nonscientists requires diverse skills that pull from multiple knowledge domains, so I am pleased that our students have access to the wide range of expertise that SUA’s faculty provides outside of the Life Sciences. Understanding science and its broader connections will enable our students to solve problems and build solutions that improve the well-being of their local communities and the wider world. What strikes you most about working with SUA students? The strength of our students played a significant role in my choice to join SUA. I’m grateful to work so closely with our undergraduates, who are a wonderfully engaged, diligent, and creative group in the classroom and the lab. Completing a research project in the lab is a never-ending process of problem-solving and working through failures. It can be very challenging for novices to accept that failure—often a lot of failures—is a standard part of the research process. I’ve found that most of the SUA students I’ve worked with have the sort of determined, growth-centered mindset that enables learning and growing from experiences of failure. These are essential attributes for our students’ development as they start their careers and their growth as future leaders and positive contributors to society. What hopes do you have for the students you’ve taught at SUA as they make their way into the world? I hope the scientific and technical knowledge they learn in my courses and lab will give them the foundation to begin a career after SUA or pursue further education at the graduate level. More broadly, I hope overall that their time at SUA, and to some small extent their time with me, will provide them with a solid basis for whichever direction in life they choose to avidly pursue. I hope our students will succeed in their careers and future endeavors, in whatever reasoned and intentional form they choose to define that success. I hope our students’ decisions will be shaped by their core beliefs and passions rather than superficial or transient factors. And I hope that they will remain responsible to themselves and those with whom they share the Earth and will seek to better the world through their actions.", "categories": ["Undergraduate Academics", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "April 26, 2023", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

What do you enjoy most about playing live? I love the thrill and rush of adrenaline I get from being on stage performing in front of an audience and feeding off their energy. It’s an opportunity for me to connect with people on a more personal level and to see firsthand how my music affects them. How did you get started working with UNICEF? What does giving back to your home country of Guatemala mean to you? I was named the first goodwill ambassador from UNICEF Guatemala in early 2020. It’s been wonderful to be a part of their ongoing work for children’s rights. It’s something that’s close to my heart and I feel very grateful that through my platform and artistry, I can give back and share a little bit of the enormous work they do. One of my favorite collaborations with them is an album I produced of children’s music sung by kids. This music, which is educational and all about having fun while learning different things, was distributed to different schools in rural villages. That’s one example of how we’ve collaborated. Do you see your music as playing a role in breaking down barriers between people? I’d like to think so, especially being a bilingual Latin artist. Music is a universal language that has the power to bring people together, regardless of where they come from. It can transcend borders, unite communities, and create more understanding and empathy. I love the fact that the music I do can somehow promote a cultural exchange and build bridges between different kinds of people. The mission of Soka University is to foster a steady stream of global citizens committed to living contributive lives. We have a lot of students and alumni who want to pursue careers in the arts. What advice would you give someone who is trying to figure out balancing the pursuit of their passions with doing good in the world? It can be a challenging task, but it is possible to achieve both if you approach it in the right way. My advice would be to take some time to reflect on what matters most to you. What are your core values, beliefs, and principles? This will help you understand what drives you and what you want to achieve in the world. Another piece of advice would be to choose a cause that aligns with your interests and passions. What artists have most inspired you, and in what ways? I’m mostly inspired by strong female artists. Nina Simone, Ella Fitzgerald, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Mavis Staples, Chavela Vargas, Lydia Mendoza, and Édith Piaf, to name a few. Their way of playing, singing, writing, and living a song is something that shakes me to my core. I know I wouldn’t be the artist I am without them. How would you encourage other artists to use their successful artistic careers to give back to communities in need? I would ask them to find a cause that they are passionate about and that goes with their values. This could be anything from supporting arts education in underprivileged communities to using their platform to raise awareness about social issues. Artists have a unique platform to reach a wide audience. It can be used to raise awareness about whatever issues or causes we are passionate about. We can do this through our art, social media, or by partnering with organizations that support these causes.", "categories": ["Campus News"], "date_publish": "March 31, 2023", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Team Shines at Prestigious University of Chicago Event", "text": "At the closing ceremony of ChoMUN, a Model United Nations conference hosted by the University of Chicago, Maria Akenkou ’25 was awarded an honorable mention for her success as a delegate. The award was a highlight of the prestigious event for SUA’s Model U.N. team. Akenkou, the club’s president, was one of seven SUA students who traveled to Chicago in late March for the three-day event. The ChoMUN conference gives students an opportunity to join committees that discuss and debate a wide range of social and political issues from the points of view of various countries. In the 26 years since its founding, ChoMUN has become one of the premier collegiate conferences, specializing in innovative committees focused on crises. “I congratulate the seven students who participated in the Chicago conference, and especially Maria, who earned respect and trust from fellow delegates in her committee and received a high distinction in her performance,” said Tetsushi Ogata ’05, visiting assistant professor of Peace and Conflict Studies and managing director of the Soka Institute for Global Solutions. Prof. Ogata has been faculty coordinator for the Model U.N. club since November 2022. Akenkou, who attended her first Model U.N. while in high school in Morocco, said winning an award “felt great” and praised the entire SUA team. “It was my first award at a university-level MUN, but I hope it won’t be the last. I am actually very proud of our team and how we put ourselves out there and connected with people from different institutions.” To prepare for ChoMUN, Akenkou and Philips Ametsikor ’25, the club’s secretary, led team members through weekly meetings where they practiced MUN procedures and terminology. As the event drew closer, students chose the committees and countries they would represent at the conference, and conducted research on particular issues they expected to debate. Akenkou worked on a bilingual committee, where she spoke Spanish and English, which tackled the topic of Chile’s independence in 1810, and Ametsikor served as a journalist on a committee that explored the role of Café Riche in the Egyptian Revolution of 1919. “I think what I personally find challenging in these competitions is opening up when I first meet everyone,” Akenkou said. “After I get comfortable, I don’t like getting too competitive but sometimes everyone wants those prizes, and internally so do I.” The desire to earn recognition, she said, prompted committee members to quickly form alliances. “In the beginning, I wasn’t even thinking about it until I realized everyone was fearful of each other, and they all trusted me, so I took my opportunity then and led most discussions,” Akenkou said. “An important lesson that I learned is how to be the person mediating in a stressful situation, bringing in alternative, original ideas that would benefit all.” Ametsikor also initially got involved in MUN while in high school and said he was immediately drawn to the opportunity to engage in global issues and diplomatic negotiations. The first collegiate conference he attended last year solidified his interest in international affairs. ChoMUN’s focus on crises made this event different from his previous MUN experiences. “This was my first crisis committee and the most challenging aspect of participating in a crisis committee is the unpredictability and fast-paced nature of the simulation, which can be overwhelming and requires quick thinking and adaptability,” Ametsikor said. “The most satisfying part was receiving a backstage note from a crisis committee and having the feeling of being in the ‘know’ and having access to information that could potentially change the simulation’s course.” Rounding out SUA’s team at ChoMUN were Abdul Alim Fatawu ’26 and Danielle Sobande ’26, who participated in a dual General Assembly on information ethics, Carol Krein Robinson ’25, who represented Morocco in an Ad Hoc General Assembly, Zama Kunene ’24, who participated on committees dealing with the formation of the East Africa Federation in 2023, and Renata Duarte Ferreira ’26, who worked on a committee focused on the rebuilding of West Germany during the Cold War in 1948. The MUN club, which welcomes all students, is now planning for future conferences at the University of Chicago, the University of Pennsylvania, Georgetown, and UCLA. Ametsikor said practicing and participating in conferences allows SUA students to explore new areas of interest and learn about global issues. Akenkou said SUA’s growing team is “well trained and ready to bring home some prizes.” Prof. Ogata agreed that being part of the MUN team offers students many benefits. “I hope that more MUN delegates from Soka will get to experience these extraordinary opportunities next year,” he said.", "categories": ["Campus News"], "date_publish": "April 26, 2023", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},
{"newspaper": "soka-news", "url": "https://www.soka.edu/news-events/news/being-soka-interview-professor-emerita-gail-thomas", "title": "Being Soka: An Interview with Professor Emerita Gail Thomas", "text": "In the 1990s, Gail Thomas took a leap of faith and left her tenured position at Texas A&M University to become a founding faculty member of Soka University of America. Now professor emerita of sociology, she is a specialist in race and gender differences, and inequality in education and employment. Thomas is a graduate of North Carolina A&T State University, one of the largest historically Black colleges and universities in America. She earned a master’s and doctorate at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. The recipient of numerous awards, she is editor of three books and has published widely in sociological and educational journals. In recognition of women’s history month, Maya Gunaseharan, manager for Diversity Initiatives and Community Building at SUA, spoke to Prof. Thomas about her journey, her confidence in her own identity, the power of a liberal arts education, and “being Soka” in the world. Joining SUA even before it had students or a campus when you were already a tenured university professor was a brave leap. What inspired you to take it? I came in 1998 before there was even a building on the ground. I was a full professor at Texas A&M. My husband also had his own career there that he left in hopes of finding suitable employment in Orange County. We also had a young son, who was not one to move or adjust readily to new schools and new environments. He cried the entire way on our drive from Texas to California. Therefore, accepting the offer to be a part of the development of a new and unknown university was truly a leap of faith. When I told my dean at Texas A&M that I was resigning, he asked if I was going through any serious personal struggles. He assumed that something was gravely wrong in my life or in my decision-making. However, I had great admiration and total confidence in SUA’s founder Daisaku Ikeda. I also believed in liberal arts education and its ability to broaden the mind, the overall person, and his or her view and contributions to humanity. I attended and had the experience of liberal arts education as an undergraduate. It was wonderful and transformative. Once I began my graduate studies and matriculated to faculty status in primarily research-focused universities, I began experiencing a different type of education and preparation for life. It was one focused more on competition than on cooperation and collaboration. It was also based on the publish-or-perish culture in academe, and individual upward mobility and status attainment. Driven by the need and pledge to do well and to succeed, I became enthralled and immersed in this production and status-attainment process. It held the promise of good jobs, upward mobility, and notoriety for those who excelled. As a woman, and particularly as an African American woman, I felt that I had to constantly prove myself and be more than enough. I was trying to climb the ladder at a time when women had many tradition-oriented male teachers and mentors in post-secondary and graduate education. They would tell women of color like me, “Don’t get pregnant,” and “Don’t drop out; prove that you were a great investment given the scholarships, funding, and opportunity that you have received.” With this advice, I ran on faith, and as fast as I could to be productive and succeed. It felt good for a while. My family’s mantra was, “Make us proud, and put our small town on the map.” I made them proud. I had to deeply reflect on who I was, what I really wanted to do, and how I wanted to show up in my career and in the world. Therefore, it was timely when I was extended an offer to join SUA, a liberal arts university that took me back to my undergraduate roots and my raison d’etre. I was ready to join in creating a new liberal arts institution from the ground up, and to co-create curricula and find students and other faculty members who wanted to be a part of building SUA. Where did your interest in studying education come from? I grew up in a small, segregated town in South Carolina. My family, my Baptist preachers, my devoted and excellent teachers, and everyone, night and day, told young people that we had to get out of this small town with limited opportunity. We were taught that education was how we would uplift ourselves and advance in the world. For many folks like me, empowering oneself, and bringing that upward mobility to myself and to my beloved family and community, were very important. For me, pursuing higher education and specializing in education were not just natural but a calling. Women have made notable progress in higher education in terms of enrollment and graduation rates. What do you see as the primary challenges for women in education going forward? I think one of the ongoing challenges—not just homework for women but for all parents, teachers, key administrators, and leaders—is to substantially increase the number and proportion of women of diverse backgrounds and minds in higher and key leadership positions in education and throughout the labor market in all fields. I also think that fostering and providing leadership opportunities for women much earlier in education, i.e., beginning with the preschool and primary levels, are critical to expanding the pipeline of women leaders. This will require the strong support and initiative of men and women already at the top of their careers and leadership who are willing to support and facilitate more diverse women in the leadership pipeline and positions. Top leaders in education and in all professions also must continue to work on reducing the pay disparity between men and women in all career fields. Lastly, a critical challenge is how we re-socialize and change the traditional mindset, beliefs, and attitudes about gender, comparable worth, and the roles that men and women should and do assume in our society. While we have and will continue to have laws and institutional mandates regarding equality and valuing all human beings, these will not change attitudes and the hard- wired traditional socialization for still too many of us humans. We need more “enlightened” men and women working together as equals to continue to grapple with these enduring challenges. Given this task of undoing some of our socialization, how do you see SUA’s role in that? When we look at what Soka means, we can refer to its mission and motto and its values. Most of us who came to SUA as pioneers were thrilled to have the opportunity to start this university from scratch. However, I think we came not only with our expertise, but also with our own expectations, values, perspectives, and biases, both known and unknown. Therefore, I think SUA’s role, and my role, is to continue to unpeel and unpack, and to be the change we want to see in the world. I think my continuing role is to manifest and articulate the meaning and goals of Soka education in my behavior, in my community, and wherever I am. My role is to continue to strive to become Soka. We could use the “carrot or the stick” approach, but I don’t think that force, manipulation, and temporary incentives will change people’s hearts at the deepest level. We must want to change. We must look again and again at ourselves. As difficult as it is, we have to take the risk to engage in honest and candid inner and outer deep dialogue with self and others to more extensively impact inner and outer change. In my daily interactions with others, I am constantly having to recognize, unpeel, and discard my own deep layers of socialization, insecurities, biases, and perceived differences. We have our SUA curricula, our beautiful buildings, and Peace Fountain. However, it’s not the walls and fountains that make Soka. Rather, I think it is each of us. Where did your own confidence in your racial and gender identity come from and develop? I must give a lot of kudos to my family. There were and are very strong, very spiritual, and very determined women in my family; we were a family of matriarchs. Therefore, the roots were there, and the plant just needed to be constantly watered. I was active in the Civil Rights movement at a time when we were focusing in my community and immediate environments on race as the major divide and culprit of inequality. However, as I look back, there was a lot of male chauvinism, inequality, and dominance within our various social movements for racial inequality and justice. I was so focused on our struggle as African Americans that I really wasn’t aware of myself or my role as a woman of color. It was largely when I entered post-secondary education and graduate school that I woke up to and experienced more of the duality of race and gender, and the impact of social class in the access, networking, sponsorship, and success of diverse individuals in education and the labor market. It became very clear to me and through my own experiences that these dynamic, moving, and persistent factors were important in shaping my life, my perception of self, my self-worth, and my opportunities. Therefore, when I think of diversity these days, it is not just the duality of being an African American woman, but the diversity in so many things, including my thoughts, my mindset, and my choices. What advice would you give to women navigating these issues today? It goes back to being the change that we each want to see. Again, I hope that more women will embrace and pursue leadership opportunities. I think we must stop wasting time debating if we are ready or good enough. It’s now time that we believe that we are, and that at all ages, we step forward with confidence! I have come to believe that we are more than we think we are, and that we can do more than we think. We must always seek and continue to learn, especially about ourselves, about being authentic, and true to ourselves. I also think that we need to form stronger bonds and human communities of care and support. You used the phrase, “being Soka.” How would you personally define that? In my opinion, Soka University of America and its mission are gifts from our founder based on his example and demonstrations of how to truly value everyone and how to live a contributive life. Thus, trying my best to live up to and model the values and ideals of Soka means striving to become and to “be Soka.” Being Soka, in my opinion, requires looking inward at who I am, what I want to give back and forward; and how I present myself in my family, in my various communities, and in the world. To be Soka requires patience and non-judgment, which are major challenges for me. It means taking risks and not being too attached to outcomes, as opportunities and things are always changing. Being Soka is beyond having titles, attachments to positions, and status. I hope and expect that our current, former, and future Soka students will give a more diverse and more extensive definition of being Soka as they discover and navigate themselves and their way in the world. In sum, I think that being Soka goes beyond a concept, a term, or a theory. It is for me a way of being and doing in every aspect of my life. Obviously, I will never be done!", "categories": ["Undergraduate Academics", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "March 28, 2023", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Mathai, who is frequently named one of Africa’s most influential women, will also be the keynote speaker at SUA’s 2023 commencement ceremony on May 26 in the Soka Performing Arts Center. Mathai’s mother, late Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Dr. Wangari Maathai, was a world-renowned activist who founded the Green Belt Movement, a grassroots environmental movement in Africa. One of Soka’s academic buildings—Maathai Hall—is named after Wangari Maathai, a testament to the global impact of their family’s work to inspire new generations of students, environmentalists, and changemakers. This will mark Mathai’s first visit to SUA; however, she gave the keynote address at Soka’s online World Summit of Educators conference in 2021. “We are excited to welcome Wanjira Mathai to SUA and have our students learn from her years of experience,” SUA President Edward M. Feasel said. “Both Mathai’s and her mother’s fearless commitment to peace and protecting our planet embody wisdom, courage, and compassion—the essential elements of global citizenship we are striving to cultivate in each student at SUA.” Mathai is the managing director for Africa and Global Partnerships at the World Resources Institute (WRI) . She formerly served as vice president and regional director for Africa, co-chair of WRI’s Global Restoration Council, and as a senior advisor to the Global Restoration Initiative. She is also the current chair of the Wangari Maathai Foundation and the former chair of the Green Belt Movement in Kenya. An inspiring leader, Mathai has over 20 years of experience advocating for social and environmental change on both local and international platforms. Over the years, Mathai has also served important strategic and advocacy roles raising the prominence and visibility of global issues such as climate change, youth leadership, sustainable energy, and landscape restoration. The Soka Global Citizen Award, inaugurated by SUA President Feasel in 2021, includes a $25,000 stipend to help continue Mathai’s important work. Mathai currently serves on the Board of the World Agroforestry Center, as a Leadership Council member of the Clean Cooking Alliance, and a member of the High-Level Group of the Africa-Europe Foundation. She is one of a few Six Seconds EQ Practitioners in Kenya and was named one of the 100 Most Influential African Women in 2018, 2020, and 2021. Mathai is the third recipient of the Soka Global Citizen Award . The previous winners are Ambassador Andrew Young, a transformational leader on the national and international stage for more than half a century, and Ambassador Anwarul K. Chowdhury, the former under-secretary-general and high representative of the United Nations, and founder of the Global Movement for the Culture of Peace.", "categories": ["Soka Global Citizen Award", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "March 16, 2023", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

The week included four events, each highlighting different aspects of Dr. King’s life and allowing participants to reaffirm their commitment to continue his work of affirming the dignity of every life. Students, faculty, and staff celebrated the MLK Day of Service on Jan. 16 by volunteering to assemble and pack food for distribution to low-income children, families, seniors, and veterans in Orange County and surrounding areas. “On MLK Day, I joined volunteers from the school and all over OC to go to the OC Food Bank,” said Sakura Okayasu ’24. “It was a wonderful experience to be able to work with my friends to pack boxes of food that were sent out to members of the community who needed them. It was also fun to see how fast we could work together as one unit.” On Jan. 17, Reverend Dr. Reginald E. Bachus, pastor of Friendship Baptist Church in Chicago and exemplar of Dr. King’s ethos, shared his experiences of applying Dr. King’s principles of non-violence through dialogue. He highlighted his lifelong pursuit of expanding hope and building a coalition to find solutions for the biggest challenges facing his community in Chicago. Reverend Bachus spoke about his experience in community building with Austin Coming Together, which includes more than 100 religious organizations with the shared purpose of improving conditions for the neighborhood of Austin on the west side of Chicago. Hundreds of volunteers stood on troubled street corners to provide a safe and crime-free environment for the community on Wednesday nights. In one case, his patience and deep care for the community members transformed a hostile dynamic with gang members who initially threatened to come to church and confront him for standing on the same corners that they typically occupied. However, they responded to Dr. Bachus’ kindness and character—his spirit to see them as human—which resulted in a bond of friendship. Selma , screened at SUA on Jan. 19, commemorates the historical events of the 1965 march for voting rights from Selma to Montgomery led by Dr. King. The movie helped students understand the compassion of Dr. King and the brutality of the authorities. After watching the film, Khurshid Engineer ’26 said the movie “displayed the severe brutality taking place in Selma and highlighted how vicious the police and the administration were toward their Black citizens, particularly the protestors.” The screening was followed by a dinner with small group discussions about the movie, the civil rights movement, and Dr. King. “From the dialogue I had with my friends after the movie, I was reassured of the importance of self-reflecting on my implicit bias every day and striving to be a good friend and family member,” said SUA graduate student Takumi Sampei ‘24. The Soka campus community concluded the week on Jan. 20 by studying Dr. King’s speech “The Three Evils of Society,” which he delivered at the National Conference on New Politics in 1967. Participants discussed the relevance of Dr. King’s message to the enduring American challenges of racism, materialism, and militarism. Gail Thomas, professor emerita of sociology, shared her experience during the civil rights movement, underscoring the importance of understanding Christianity to comprehend the allegories in Dr. King’s speeches and actions, as his life and work were deeply informed by his Christian faith. “It was such an insightful meeting not just to learn and hear directly from Dr. King, but also to have a wonderful space to engage in a dialogue with peers on these important topics,” said Yuya Uchida, manager of overseas development at SUA.", "categories": ["REHR Center", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "February 16, 2023", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Before competitions in the California Pacific Conference, a 13-member collegiate athletic conference that SUA joined in 2012, student-athletes from both schools read a statement over the public address system that defines five key values to embody in sports and beyond. The 30-second statement was created by members of Cal Pac’s Student-Athlete Council, led by Chase Buchert ’23, and highlights the values of integrity, respect, responsibility, sportsmanship, and servant-leadership. (to be read aloud over PA by the captains of both teams.) We represent the student-athletes of ___________ and __________. We are part of the California Pacific Conference, a five-star conference of character in the N.A.I.A. We invite our teammates, fans, and friends to join us in following these core values during this game and in life. RESPONSIBILITY We accept personal responsibility for living out our values and ideals. If change is to be, it is up to me, and you, and all of us. Join us in taking personal responsibility for your actions today. INTEGRITY We desire to live lives of quality and impact, being true to our ideals and values even when no one else is looking. We will pursue personal truth as we are strive to become men and women of character. SERVANT-LEADERSHIP There is no greater good than investing one’s life in improving the lives of others. We can make a difference in our world by serving others right where we are right now. SPORTSMANSHIP We recognize there is a person in each uniform, not merely a number or a school name. We will honor one another by competing according to the rules of our sport, our school, our conference, and our society. RESPECT Our opponents and teammates are human beings of immense value as individuals. We will respect one another despite our differences, and remind each other we have zero tolerance for discrimination of any kind in our games, colleges, and communities. We agree these values are essential in sport and community, and we will play according to them today as together we accomplish “Greater Things” in the California Pacific Conference. “It was something that we wanted to reiterate because we found that a lot of student-athletes didn’t really know about those values,” Buchert said. “We wanted to implement a reminder not only for students, but for spectators, referees, and everyone.” Buchert, who has played soccer since his first year on campus, was elected chair of the council after a year serving with Cienna Irwin ’25 as the two SUA representatives to the group. A five-minute version of the statement was read before some games last year, but after the council received feedback that it was too long, they distilled the announcement to its essence. “We really focused on making it concise, and making sure every student-athlete genuinely understands what’s being said and the impact behind it,” said Buchert. “At the end of the day, these are values that are bigger than athletics. They are community-based, service-based, and bigger than any individual.” Buchert discussed the statement and other initiatives of the Student-Athlete Council at the conference’s President’s Council meeting at SUA in January, attended by Jim Carr, the president of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, SUA President Edward Feasel, and presidents and athletic directors from other conference schools. “Chase has been a major contributor to the development of the Cal Pac value statement,” said SUA Athletic Director Mike Moore. “His efforts helped create a statement that all athletes in the conference should strive for—to be better people during their athletic careers and beyond.” In addition to a presentation on the values statement, which Buchert hopes will be a model for conferences nationwide, he spoke to the President’s Council about the significance of having a student-athlete council on each campus to open direct lines of communication between administrations and athletes, as well as the passing of a mandatory day-off rule. Though the Cal Pac has a rule that allows for one day of rest a week, it isn’t enforced by the NAIA at this time. Buchert, who has focused on humanities at SUA and will pursue an M.A. at Hope International University in Fullerton, where he will continue to play soccer, says the value statement has been an opportunity for him to consider his own behavior off the field as well. “It allowed me to kind of take a step back and reflect about the values that I genuinely want to embody,” he said. “Obviously, athletics has been a big part of my experience, but it won’t always be.” Buchert, who would “100% choose SUA again,” said being part of the athletic community on campus and with the council has been rewarding personally and professionally. “Student-athletes here are intelligent, awesome individuals to be around and also perform well athletically, and I’ve been so happy with the environment and the team,” he said. While meeting presidents and leaders from conference schools can be “nerve-wracking,” Buchert is grateful for the experience. “I’ve been able to push myself and work on my communicative abilities, which has made a world of a difference. I don’t see myself sitting back anymore,” he said. “I know that I’ve been able to kind of provide a voice for somebody who may not have the opportunity, so I just want to make sure that I can keep uplifting as many voices as I can.”", "categories": ["Campus News"], "date_publish": "February 16, 2023", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

SUA Distinguished Adjunct Professor Alexander Harang will join Dr. Asle Toje, deputy leader of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, for an insider’s view of how the Peace Prize laureate is selected and a discussion of the most pressing peace issue of our time: the threat of nuclear weapons. “This event marks the beginning of a new partnership for us,” said SUA President Edward M.

The Nobel Seminars, an important new partnership between SUA and the Nobel Institute in Oslo, Norway, launched January 31 with “The Nobel Peace Prize: Can It Influence World Peace?” The wide-ranging discussion between Dr. Asle Toje, deputy leader of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, and SUA Distinguished Adjunct Professor Alexander Harang, head of politics at No to Nuclear Weapons and former leader of the Norwegian Peace Association, highlighted the role of the annual prize on the world stage as well as that of each individual in promoting peace. Although even a prize as illustrious as the Nobel cannot create peace, Dr. Toje said the global media attention the annual announcement in Oslo receives can be a thumb on the scale. “It is our chance to draw attention to the work of individuals and institutions towards peace,” Dr. Toje said. In welcoming guests to the SUA Athenaeum, SUA President Edward Feasel noted that the Nobel Seminars are building on Soka’s rich history of promoting peace. The father of Soka education, Tsunesaburo Makiguchi, died in prison while being held for his opposition to the Second World War. His disciple, Jōsei Toda, was also imprisoned but survived, and in 1957 denounced nuclear weapons and called for their elimination. SUA founder Daisaku Ikeda has continued that call in his annual peace proposals. Somewhat surprisingly, Dr. Toje told the audience that his own path differed from that of many in the peace movement. With a background in war studies, he once defended nuclear weapons as a means to create stability during the Cold War. That position changed over time. “I began to realize that in a multipolar world it will become increasingly difficult to avoid the first use of nuclear weapons. And once nuclear weapons have been used we’re in uncharted territory, uncharted territory that could lead to the end of civilization,” said Dr. Toje, who was previously research director at the Norwegian Nobel Institute in Oslo, a lecturer and professor at numerous universities, and is the author of The European Union as a Small Power: After the Post-Cold War. Each year, the five-member Nobel Committee evaluates hundreds of individuals and organizations to determine the laureate—a task Dr. Toje admitted comes with pressure. Alfred Nobel’s criteria for the prize, one of five awards he endowed with the fortune he’d made as an inventor with more than 350 patents, including one for dynamite, were that recipients were to be chosen from among three groups: those who work for fraternity among nations, the reduction or abolishment of standing armies, and those who promulgate the spreading of peace. Dr. Toje said the prize has most frequently been awarded to those working toward disarmament. Noting that many people say the world is more at risk than ever of a nuclear war, Prof. Harang—who’d introduced his fellow Norwegian as a national treasure and the embodiment of SUA’s founding values of wisdom, courage, and compassion—asked what efforts and actions the committee looks toward as most likely to increase security. Dr. Toje agreed that following the Cold War, countries have “fallen back into great power rivalry and great power conflict.” To prevent catastrophes around the world, Dr. Toje said a pledge of no first use is essential. The next step is the process of arms reduction. “I think that any sane person would agree that even if you subscribe to the idea that great powers need to have a weapon of such destruction … there are far too many nuclear weapons in existence today,” he said. “There is no need to have a planet-destroying capacity.” By regularly turning the world’s attention toward the topic of nuclear disarmament, Dr. Toje said the Peace Prize sends a powerful message. “I like to think that the anti-nuclear movement has been indispensable in creating our greatest shield against nuclear war. And that is the nuclear taboo,” he said. “The fact that that has not yet happened does not dampen our spirits. And I think in the years to come the Nobel Peace Prize will continue to be a thorn in the side of the powerful, of the authoritarians, and a beacon of hope for those who are working towards a more peaceful world, a world where each nation and each country, and each individual can live in prosperity and harmony and peace.” Prior to the event, Dr. Toje met with students in Prof. Harang’s learning cluster on the Nobel Peace Prize, who offered their own nominations for this year’s prize. Dr. Toje said he found their choices impressive enough to voice on behalf of SUA to the committee. “I’ve taught at universities around the world, and the caliber of your students is magnificent,” he said. “And the caliber has very much to do with the way people are educated at this university, which is distinct. There is an idea, a philosophy driving this university, and at the core of the philosophy is peace. Peace within, peace without.” Dr. Toje encouraged everyone in the audience to recognize their own role in promoting peace, regardless of what they do in the world. Noting that during the Cuban missile crisis, as President John F. Kennedy was pressured by many to launch a nuclear weapon, it was the lone voice of his brother, Robert Kennedy, that stopped him. Even in casual conversations with friends, Dr. Toje urged audience members, “be an advocate for the course of peace and to take your reasonings and your logic, the better angels of our nature, as President Lincoln famously called it, and let that be your guiding star, because we don’t know who of you will be the one to save the world.”", "categories": ["Campus News"], "date_publish": "February 14, 2023", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

The grant will be used for university facilities and programs. Supervisor Bartlett and Mayor Chun have led distinguished careers of volunteerism and community service. Supervisor Bartlett began her career as a public servant in 2006 as an elected member of the Dana Point City Council, where she served as mayor and mayor pro-tem for the city. She was elected to the Orange County Board of Supervisors in 2014, re-elected in 2018, and served as chairwoman of the Board of the Board of Supervisors in 2016 and 2019. Supervisor Bartlett also spearheaded the partnership between Orange County, the City of Aliso Viejo, and SUA when the university served as a Super Point of Dispensing for COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Between January and June that year, 296,594 people were vaccinated at SUA. Mayor Chun started his second term as the mayor of Aliso Viejo in 2022 after many years of volunteerism. His contributions to the city began with his appointment to the Parks and Recreation Committee, and he later served as mayor pro-tem in 2018 and 2021 and mayor (for the first time) in 2019. Chun, who will complete his second year-long stint as mayor this month, remains on the city council. “The influence of this university is felt throughout our local community and beyond,” Mayor Chun said.

{"newspaper": "soka-news", "url": "https://www.soka.edu/news-events/news/professor-chika-esiobu-power-indigenous-knowledge", "title": "Professor Chika Esiobu on the Power of Indigenous Knowledge", "text": "Attending the same Nigerian high school where author Chimamanda Adichie studied, which shared a campus with where Chinua Achebe lectured, fueled Prof. Chika Esiobu’s desire to affect the world through her writing and positive portrayal of Africa. She continued her education at the University of Warwick in England and Howard University, where she earned a doctorate in African Development and Policy. Professor Esiobu taught at the University of Rwanda and California State University Dominguez Hills before joining SUA this academic year as a visiting professor in African Studies and Economic Development. One of the courses she’s teaching this semester focuses on her primary interest: Indigenous knowledge. She is also a fiction writer and documentarian. How would you define Indigenous values? I think we have to start by asking why it has to be that the term “Indigenous” is attached to values. And that’s because there has been an overshadowing of the values of some groups around the world. There has been an imbalance whereby a particular knowledge system, a particular value system, has been promoted as mainstream. The whole idea of advancing an Indigenous knowledge system is about bringing balance, where we say that everyone can coexist and that every knowledge system should be validated and should be respected for what it is. In the United States many people think of Native Americans when we think of Indigenous knowledge, and the same is true in other countries regarding the first inhabitants of those lands. What, if anything, ties them together? That’s a question that comes up a lot in trying to explore Indigenous knowledge. Well-meaning people start asking whose knowledge is Indigenous knowledge, and is there one strand of knowledge that runs through all these communities? The quick response is that it is not so much about the manifestations of the knowledge that we get from different communities, but the philosophy that runs through them. That is why we call it a system. If I go to the Navajos for their traditional medicine, for instance, I will be treated differently than if I go to the Kikuyu in Kenya. However, one philosophy in both those treatments will be human connection. I will be treated because I am a human being and not because of money, and the source of the therapies will respect the earth and respect that I am human not only because of my physical body, but because I have a spirit, a soul. Those are all the philosophies that run through Indigenous knowledge across different communities. Was there a particular experience that crystallized your interest in this? While a doctoral student, I worked with the World Bank on projects in Rwanda and Nigeria. I had put a lot of faith and confidence in that institution, but I found there was a lot of imposition of Western knowledge and Western methods on the African continent. I had two conversations that helped change my perspective. One was with a supervisor when I brought to his attention that a project wasn’t working, and he said that he knew it wasn’t but we just had to make it work. The project was packaged in Washington, D.C., and exported to the continent, and at great cost to the country. That didn’t sit very well with me. The second conversation was about a particular agricultural practice exported to a community in Nigeria that had failed woefully. The farmers then used an Indigenous method that they had been forced to abandon as a result of colonialism and interventions from external institutions, and it worked. That helped me realize I had to study Indigenous knowledge. (Watch professor Esiobu’s TED Talk on the project) As this knowledge was developed largely at a time when the environment itself was different, how much will climate change impact these practices? That is a question we are asking and that we don’t have an answer to yet. Indigenous methods existed when the climate was more stable, reliable, and predictable. They were intended to ensure balance, not to restore balance. But we do know that the earth is resilient. It is able to recreate, just as a tree that is cut can grow back. Africa is so vulnerable to the effects of climate change, much more than countries that actually generate what causes climate change. For instance, the flooding this year is phenomenal and has never happened before. So it’s not only saying that Africa should go back to implementing Indigenous knowledge. It’s the question of ‘What is the world going to do?’ The whole world is interconnected. What has been your experience so far at SUA? SUA is an institution that represents what I stand for at the core, which is peace, harmony, connectedness, equity, and harmony. It is really all about balance, where we all recognize that we can work together in a way that validates rather than invalidates another person who might have an opinion that seems to be radically different, or who may not look the same as we do. It is understanding this core thread of humanity that holds us all together. I have been working on Indigenous knowledge for 15 years, and this is the first time I’ve taught a class about it. Not a lot of professors get the privilege of teaching a class in the area they are focusing on. I’m excited by the openness of SUA students to learn more. These students have to face climate change and they’re asking questions. They’re asking the generation before them, ‘How did you let this happen?’ So if they get to learn that there is an alternative to the way the generation before them treated the earth they really are happy to embrace that and learn more about traditional ecological knowledge. Tell us about the creative projects you’re pursuing when you’re not teaching. I also write fiction. I see it as a form of writing that a lot of people can identify with. I write historical fiction and romantic comedy. My first manuscript was shortlisted for the Penguin Prize for African Writing in 2010, and I have had a few short stories published. I’m now completing my third novel. My first documentary , on Indigenous knowledge and women’s empowerment in Rwanda, came out three years ago. I have another in post-production now that’s about traditional bone setting in Nigeria. So if members of the community see my name on a novel, they shouldn’t be confused.

In October, the DEI office conducted allyship training, distributed ally packs, and shared more Soka Story Corps experiences with our community. This month it hosted an alternative way to think about Thanksgiving. The DEI Office organized its first Allyship Training on Oct. 25. Meg E. Evans, director of education and research at Break Away, facilitated the training, which focused on educating Soka faculty and staff on LGBTQ2+ identities. Evans discussed language, laws, politics, and statistics and shared practices for promoting LGBTQ2+ safety and inclusion. The training helped expand the understanding of LGBTQ2+ communities and how best to support them on campus. An ally is a person who is committed to fighting discrimination and prejudices by educating themself, challenging their biases, collaborating with society, and taking action toward creating positive change. An ally pack assists people in the work of building a wise, compassionate, and collaborative community where everyone is treated with equity and dignity. The DEI office released an ally pack on Latine Heritage Month (Sept. 15–Oct. 15) this October. In its ongoing effort to create a culture of belonging and inclusion, the DEI office intentionally chose to use the term “Latine” from “Latinx.” You can learn more about the terms and Latine heritage here . The DEI Office also released a LGBTQ+ ally pack , providing an overview of LGBT History Month (October), National Coming Out Day (October 11), and International Pronouns Day (October 19). The pack included the voices of Taiji Morgan ’24 (they/them) and Audrey Chu ’24 (they/them). It also shared how to engage in value-creating conversations with LGBTQ+ folks as an ally. Soka community members are invited to share personal stories with members of the broader community. Through this effort, the DEI Office hopes to record and preserve the various voices of Soka to heighten awareness and empathy for the nuanced human experience that surrounds diversity, equity, and inclusion and how it shows up in each community member. This October, the DEI Office released LGBT History Month Story Corps , in which Jaime Dance, assistant director of residential life, shared her experiences and the significance of LGBT history month to her: a time to be celebrated and connected to community. Many of us who grew up in the United States are accustomed to the tradition of gathering together and sharing food during the Thanksgiving holiday. The DEI office wanted to offer that experience to students who might not have had that opportunity, while also acknowledging the truth of the origins of Thanksgiving. “Thankstaking” recognizes the unlawful theft of the land of Indigenous people who were here first and continue to fight for human rights. The Nov. 18 event included conversation, dinner, and music and was held in the spirit of understanding that gratitude looks different in other parts of the world and with the aim to learn about diverse perspectives from each other.", "categories": ["DEI", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "November 21, 2022", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},
{"newspaper": "soka-news", "url": "https://www.soka.edu/news-events/news/dr-shane-barter-reflections-his-experience-election-observer", "title": "Dr. Shane Barter: Reflections on His Experience as an Election Observer", "text": "Free and fair elections are crucial to democracy, and Shane Barter, professor of comparative politics and director of the International Studies concentration, recently returned from observing elections in Kazakhstan. Dr. Barter joined the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) mission to observe the country’s presidential election on November 20. Dr. Barter, who joined SUA in 2011, has worked with various groups observing elections since 2003. He is currently working on a book on territorial autonomy that examines special forms of self-government for territorially concentrated minority nations, such as Quebec, Scotland, and Tibet. This January, he is taking an SUA Learning Cluster class to Wales to study that country’s governance. How did your trip to Kazakhstan come about? There are various international groups that a country can invite to observe an election, and each has a roster of experts. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is one of the largest groups, and through Canadem (a Canadian NGO), I was invited to apply in late October. Within a couple days I had a phone interview, and a few days later I was accepted. It was then lightning speed completing the extensive paperwork together with the training sessions. I became part of a 300-person observation team and was deployed to the southern province of Kyzylorda for the November 20 vote. What was your experience once you were on site? As an international observer, you are provided access for in-depth observation at all stages of the election process. There are long-term observers that are on the ground several weeks before the election, who are able to observe the entire campaign. I served as a short-term observer, arriving at a particular site a few days before the vote. You witness the immediate lead up, election day, and then the tabulation of votes. Election day is exhausting. I started at about 6 a.m. and finished around 2 a.m. the next day. As an election observer, you are not a monitor. You are not a police officer, and you are not there to fix things. You are there to observe, with your observations becoming part of a larger pool across 150 or so teams. On this mission, we had pens with an electronic sensor, so when we filled out forms with the data that the OSCE was interested in, it automatically uploaded the data into our smartphones and to the mission center. If you see something you think is troubling or amiss, then the mission center can see if it is random or if there is an accumulation of similar problems. Can you tell us a bit about the history of election observation? One of the earliest examples was the Philippines in the 1980s, when a student-led group, which eventually became the Asian Network for Free Elections, were observers and their work helped show that former President Ferdinand Marcos was cheating. Since then, election observation has grown across Eastern Europe and has become the norm in democratizing countries. Observers might catch cheating or identify problems that a country can then respond to. Having foreign observers can also help prevent groups from cheating or using violence or intimidation. The idea is to give a bit of an assist to pro-democratic forces within a given country. How did you get your start doing this? I was working as an intern for a Thai human rights group in 2003 called Forum-Asia, and they needed someone to help observe a Cambodian election. After that, I worked with them in Indonesia, and then was invited by the Carter Center to become a long-term observer for the 2004 U.S. presidential elections. It was a really enriching process. I got to follow campaigns, meet with journalists, and look into various allegations and report back to the headquarters. The Carter Center has been really innovative, inviting countries that are less democratic to see firsthand how elections are done. They sometimes also bring people from around the world to the U.S. to observe, so it is less about democratic Western countries observing non-Western countries. I also worked for the European Union in Indonesia in 2006, then as a polling worker in Canada and the U.S, and went to Ukraine in 2019. How do these visits impact your own ideas about democracy? I think that sometimes people think it’s cool to criticize democracy. I think people take it for granted. Meanwhile, people in other countries might struggle and die for it. For me, democracy is not some whipping post that you criticize because someone got elected that you don’t like. It is a much deeper idea about how we live, and fairness and minority rights. So the idea of playing some small role to work with the international community to help pro-democracy voices appeals to me. When you go into rural areas in a country and meet people at polling stations, they see that their work matters and that the world actually cares. There’s a degree of solidarity. Even just the stories you tell while having a cup of coffee together about the weaknesses of elections in one’s own country helps foster such solidarity. How do these trips dovetail with SUA’s mission? Of course, part of SUA’s mission is to foster global citizenship. Let’s not be uncritical of the idea of global citizenship, which could be seen by some as elitist or assimilationist. But there’s a lot of value in transcending borders, making connections to other places, and humbly trying to educate yourself about other places so you can better learn about your own home. As an International Studies professor going to Kazakhstan, I recognized that I didn’t know enough about Central Asia, which is such an important region. And when I told friends that I was going, they just didn’t have anything to say because they knew so little. We have a few students from Kazakhstan at SUA who taught me a lot before I went. I loved the things they suggested—the foods they wanted me to try, the sites I should see. This really helped me during my brief mission. For example, one student sent me some of her favorite music to listen to before I left. Just after I met the local driver and translator, one of the songs on the radio was one I knew and could hum along to. That helped me connect with them a little bit right away. In terms of the political landscape, my visit gave me more insight into where they are now and the challenge of creating durable political parties. With Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, there is a fear that Kazakhstan could be next. They also have a lot of Russian men who do not want to be drafted coming into the country. So there’s a lot of tension, and the country is literally a crossroads in terms of Islam, Russia, and connections to China and East Asia, but also a country that wants to be linked to the West and balance external influences. My experience has already influenced my teaching. In my course on democracy and democratization, we did a session on election observation and the rise of non-traditional, maybe less democratic election observer groups that will certify elections with very different standards than more established groups. I was excited to return and share my hands-on experiences, hopefully enriching the course in terms of real-time democracy promotion. If working as an election observer in Kazakhstan encourages people to learn more about Kazakhstan and the value of democracy, then we have created something truly valuable.", "categories": ["Undergraduate Academics", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "December 14, 2022", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

With the opportunity to build upon their strong foundation, the next chapter of their academic career slowly begins to take shape. The traditional approach is to pour over catalogs, emails, and websites to engage oneself in the available content of course listings, photo libraries, and media posts. Moreover, it is also common to compare campus elements and extracurriculars, including sports, networking opportunities, and location features. Essential questions naturally present themselves, considering fit, safety, personal needs, and the ability to perpetuate a sense of global citizenship. While these aspects combine to form a well-rounded base for diligent research, reading and reviewing material can grow repetitive, and the urge to immerse oneself in campus life becomes increasingly palpable. At Soka, we highly encourage any prospective student to engage in campus tours to address those tough questions and dive headlong into the energy of higher education with a sense of authentic purpose. Our intimate setting both appreciates and supports the dynamic preferences of individual students and strives tirelessly to provide the bounty of information one might need to reach well-thought-out conclusions that best serve their unique desires.

Soka University of America’s 2022 commencement ceremony on May 27 felt especially joyful as it was the first held in person since 2019. More than 600 guests, including families holding handmade signs brandishing their graduate’s name, faculty and staff, and commencement speaker Nobel Peace Prize laureate Dr. Shirin Ebadi came together to congratulate the graduates. President Edward Feasel, joined by Professor Tomoko Takahashi, dean of the graduate school and vice president for institutional research and assessment, and Professor Michael Weiner, vice president for academic affairs and interim dean of faculty, conferred the Master of Arts degree in Educational Leadership and Societal Change to four graduate candidates and the Bachelor of Arts degree in Liberal Arts to 105 undergraduate candidates. Each of those graduates, Pres. Feasel said, has a unique contribution to make to society. He recalled that in his own youth he’d been strongly impacted by university founder Daisaku Ikeda’s words that a person discovers a mission by climbing the mountain that is in front of them and developing the muscles and strength to take the next steps. “Those who remember they have a unique mission are strong,” he said, quoting Mr. Ikeda. “Whatever problems they have, they will never be defeated. They can transform all of their problems into catalysts for growth toward a hope-filled future.” Now that the graduates had scaled the mountain of their education, Pres. Feasel said, they were prepared to climb to the next summit. “Along your journey you will certainly face challenges, the greatest of which is often one’s own self; the challenge to maintain the confidence and belief in yourself,” he said. “But I hope in those moments, you will remember back to your days at SUA and know that all of us here fully believe in each and every one of your potential and ability.” Dean of Students Hyon Moon then read a commencement message from the founder for the undergraduate and graduate classes of 2022. “My beloved graduates,” Mr. Ikeda wrote, “precisely because you stand today on the cusp of an arduous journey in an era of trial and turmoil, I offer these words on your departure: Summon forth resounding courage and exercise your true worth as global citizens of Soka.” Marking her first visit to Soka in more than a decade, lawyer, activist, and Nobel winner Dr. Ebadi offered an inspiring keynote speech that emphasized the importance of recognizing the interconnectedness of all humans. Dr. Ebadi encouraged listeners to “wish for others a world like the one we enjoy.” Creating that world requires active and vigilant participation in democracy, she said, noting how recent events in the United States indicate that democracy can be attacked at any time. “Citizens’ duties are not only participation in elections and the ballot box,” she said. “The more important duty of citizens is supervising democracy very carefully. The activities of all of those who have been elected have to be supervised, so that they perform their duties to the best of their ability.” Dr. Ebadi referred to the potential reversal of Roe v. Wade by the US Supreme Court and called for women’s sovereignty over their bodies. “Women’s bodies belong to women and no one else has the right to determine what a woman does with her own body,” she said. “Therefore, we must peacefully defend this right and not let a matter of discrimination backslide.” Another world event that calls attention to the need to recognize all people as equal is the Ukrainian refugee crisis. Despite the clear need for worldwide assistance for Ukrainian refugees, Dr. Ebadi suggested that people reflect on whether “refugees who are Muslims and people of color, fleeing wars in their countries,” are treated similarly. “Should this be the case,” she said, “continuing such discriminatory behavior is an example of backsliding of the principle of equality of human beings, and we should not be indifferent to it. Discrimination and injustice can spread like a virus in the society. Injustice to you is the first step of injustice to me. Let’s not be indifferent!” The students chosen by their classmates as speakers—Naphon Golf Petplai, Subina Thapaliya, Tayná Baptista Ferreira, and Khai Phyn Teo—described the impact their Soka years have had on their path to global citizenship. Petplai, who joined Thapaliya and Ferreira to represent undergraduates, said his Soka education led to an understanding of the interconnectedness Dr. Ebadi had referenced. “Soka liberated me from defining myself based on social categories like gender, race, religion, and economic background,” Petplai said. “Soka breaks down those walls between our values that may seem incompatible with each other. Soka teaches us to use wisdom to see how every aspect of our identity interconnects with one another. Soka trains you to become people who can connect any gap, between people’s hearts, between our ideals and the harsh realities of society. That is the true strength of a liberal artist.” Graduate student speaker Teo, a two-time SUA graduate and first-generation international student from Malaysia, noted the various challenges many students faced to get to this moment. “If you identify as a person of color—especially a woman of color—or queer, an immigrant or a child of immigrants, a first-gen student, disabled, struggle with physical or mental health, or if you’re coming from a developing or underdeveloped country, you deserve more than congratulations,” Teo said. “Being here means not only we’ve made it, but it’s also a victory for our families, our communities, a victory for all of those who came before us and who had to sacrifice their lives so that we could be here today, and a victory for those who are counting on us to pave the way for them.” Teo credited the graduate program and Soka for helping them become “more than what I envisioned myself to be.” Thapaliya returned to the podium to receive the Founders Award, which honors the graduating undergraduate who exemplifies the university’s ideals through service and academic excellence. Thapaliya, who plans to attend graduate school and return to Nepal to give back to her community and create opportunities for others there, recalled finding inspiration as a child in a book her father had given her about a boy who had lost his parents to social and political turmoil, but after getting an education helped overthrow a tyrannical ruler. “I vividly remember lying on a tattered straw mat on a muddy porch, years ago in a small village in Southern Nepal and dreaming about attending a university,” she said. “I started visualizing the pursuit of wisdom and knowledge as my tools to bring transformations in my own life, and in the lives of people around me.” A decade later, the reality “feels way more beautiful than the dream, and that is because of the sincere support and friendship that I have experienced here.”", "categories": ["Commencement", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "June 21, 2022", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

The club was founded by SUA undergraduate students in September 2017, driven by a desire to translate the university’s values of peace, human rights, and the sanctity of life into concrete action. The founding members derived inspiration from SUA founder Daisaku Ikeda’s 2006 peace proposal, in which he called on young people to build “a student-centered network to support the United Nations.” The club’s first and second symposiums, which focused on youth engagement and nuclear disarmament, were held in 2018 and 2019. In her opening remarks, former club president Subina Thapaliya ’22 acknowledged the two-year gap between symposiums and the deeper understanding of the fragility and interconnectedness of life shared by many after braving the pandemic. Erica Koyama ’23, who spoke as a student representative, said she believes this school year marked a pivotal moment for SUA with the official opening of Marie and Pierre Curie Hall. She also noted the significance of SUA emerging from the pandemic with a more distinct emphasis on the sciences. “As we shift to embrace this new concentration,” Koyama said, “we are confronted with a need to widen the scope of how we discuss matters regarding peace. So today, I request all of you, members of the Soka community, to reflect on this question: How can science further the culture of peace?” One highlight from the symposium was the frank discussion between students and SUA donor and former Soka Bistro chef Kiyoko Trobaugh. Hoping to support SUA with more than merely monetary donations, she attended culinary school to become a chef, earned her certification, and became one of the first chefs to work in the Soka Bistro. She was a caring and loving mother figure for many SUA students during the decade she worked in the cafeteria from 2001 until retiring in 2011. When asked what hopes she has for current students at SUA, Trobaugh said, “Even if you do not do well sometimes, don’t be afraid and don’t be harsh on yourself.

Two years into his education at Soka, Pham, along with Sofia Vitale ‘25, was among 25 students accepted to the University of Michigan’s weeklong Developing Future Biologists program in May. “They actually talked a lot about what we did in Integrated Biology and Chemistry,” Pham said, referring to a prerequisite class taught by Professor Susan Walsh and Professor Robert Levenson in the Life Sciences concentration at SUA. Pham and Vitale took this class in the spring of 2022, where they worked on problem sets and wet labs to apply what they learned to real case studies. During the weeklong program at Michigan, students received a comprehensive education in the foundational concepts of developmental biology from leaders in the field in small classes with a 3:1 student-to-instructor ratio. They spent each morning learning about embryogenesis, organogenesis, signaling pathway mutations, or development and disease. Multiple morning workshops also informed students about career options in science. In the afternoons, they used cutting-edge techniques and model organisms to hone their laboratory research skills in a mixture of dry and wet labs. Students coded with R and ImageJ in the dry labs and performed experiments with model organisms like drosophila, zebrafish, and mouse embryos in the wet labs. The evenings centered around informal activities like bowling, tie-dying t-shirts, and picnicking in a park so that students could bond with each other. Vitale, who currently studies reflectin proteins as a research assistant under Prof. Levenson, said the program was life-changing. “It was fully funded, which made it possible for me to attend,” Vitale said. Reflecting on the courses that led him to the program, Pham singled out a marine biology course taught by Professor Marie Nydam that sparked his interest in ecology and evolution. The class visited tide pools in Dana Point to measure the diversity of organisms, including sea stars, barnacles, and sea anemones. Pham went on to work in Nydam’s lab in the spring of 2022, and he plans to continue working over the summer. Having the opportunity to talk with professors and work in the lab helped him realize his interest in and talent for research. Participating in the program motivated Vitale to consider research as a potential career path. For Pham, exploring Michigan’s graduate-level labs and speaking with professors, PhD students, and other undergraduates encouraged him to become a scientist. “I was able to enjoy my learning experience [at the University of Michigan] because I had a strong foundation,” said Pham, a foundation he attributes to his studies at Soka. —Nugnandini Chhetri ’25", "categories": ["Undergraduate Academics", "Life Sciences", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "July 13, 2022", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

After a video she made about her experience as an international student from Brazil went viral—about three million people viewed the one-minute post—she was on her way to becoming a social media influencer. Since that unexpected breakthrough, Paié Pinto has posted dozens of videos, in her native Portuguese, and built a community of almost 8,000 followers on YouTube alone. Her success has also impacted SUA. The Office of Admission saw 500% growth in submitted applications from Brazil between fall 2021 and 2022. “A lot of people have the desire to study abroad, but they think it is really hard or that you have to be rich,” Paié Pinto said. “When I started posting, it was to show that it was possible, that if you have this dream you can achieve this.” As a child, Paié Pinto had gone to a Soka school in Sao Paulo until she was 7 years old. Years later, she reflected on its values as she grew discontented with the path of declaring a major and applying to a Brazilian university that her highly competitive high school was preparing her to follow. She wanted something different: an opportunity to study abroad and return to the kind of supportive environment she fondly recalled from her childhood school. Paié Pinto visited Soka University in Japan, where she knew several students, but was unsure about being so far away from her family in Brazil. A trip to SUA made her decision easy. “It was the right thing for me,” she said. “I just followed my heart.” In her second year on campus, Paié Pinto started an Instagram account focused on her life at SUA. She kept the account private so she could see who was following it. “I was actually very shy,” she said. Only a week after she started, SUA’s campus closed because of the pandemic. Back in Brazil, remote learning was proving difficult. Paié Pinto was studying international relations but wasn’t sure about where it would take her after college, and she missed the non-academic aspects of SUA life. While scrolling through TikTok one day, she noticed people posting about how they had achieved a particular goal. Paié Pinto made a video about how she’d gotten to SUA, with images of herself studying in high school and then on Soka’s campus. People began asking questions about the school, the process of applying, and studying abroad. Her viral video was a response to some of those questions. Her initial resistance to the exposure of social media, and concerns that people might view her as trying to become famous, began to dissolve as her videos seemed to help high school students who had the same hopes she once had. “What’s interesting about this whole thing is that I only realized what I wanted to do when my TikTok went viral,” said Paié Pinto, who has changed her concentration to social and behavioral science. “I always liked to edit videos and edit pictures—my mom’s a photographer, my brother’s a photographer and a graphic designer—but I never really thought about doing something related to it as my career. I’ve found a way to connect the things that I like to helping people as well.” Paié Pinto’s posts with the most views are those emphasizing the good, and often unusual, aspects about the university: all students receiving laptop computers, for example, or that students can study abroad without paying additional tuition. While those videos capture people’s attention, and are important for students with financial constraints, Paié Pinto is careful to present the whole picture as she views it. “I don’t want to show an image that Soka is perfect, or to try to bring students here for the wrong reasons,” she said. The cadence of social media rewards people who post frequently. Paié Pinto does feel some pressure to do so, but is careful to remember her priorities are her studies as well as the campus experience she is posting about. Creating and editing videos can be time-consuming. Paié Pinto said she has many requests from people who want her to make videos in English, but doing so would add more time to the process as she’d need to add subtitles for her predominantly Portuguese-speaking followers. Valentina Einsfeld ’26 was one of those followers. Einsfeld, who’s from Porto Alegre, Brazil, described herself as “one of the lucky three” students from that country in the current first-year class. “Giulia’s video was very persuasive,” said Einsfeld. “She showed SUA’s best qualities, from the beauty of the campus to the generosity of the donors. But what was most interesting to me was the study abroad opportunity. She did a wonderful job displaying how amazing the university is and how special its opportunities are.” Renata Duarte Ferreira ‘26, of São Paulo, was online looking for colleges in the United States when she found Paié Pinto’s YouTube channel and TikTok video. “She helped me a lot with amazing information about Soka,” she said. Social media, Ferreira said, is a great way to learn about what makes a college special. “Students can share the real experience of studying at the college, and they show many things that are not available on the university’s website,” said Ferreira. Einsfeld agrees. “I would have never found SUA without Giulia’s post. Today social media is the most efficient way to get your message across. Giulia’s three million views in the video got me here today, and her platform grows fast.” Paié Pinto appreciates when students thank her, but doesn’t want to take all the credit when SUA students tell her they are here because of her videos. “I tell them, ‘no, you are here because of you,’” she said. “You knew of Soka because of me, but the rest is totally up to you.”", "categories": ["Campus News"], "date_publish": "December 16, 2022", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

It was an ideal moment to find a new way to mark the anniversary and showcase the power of community. The vibrancy of the SUA family was the theme of a celebration that drew about 300 students, faculty, and staff. Guests heard from campus leaders, alumni, and keynote speaker Ceasar McDowell before they filled the campus green to enjoy conversations, games, and food trucks serving cuisines from around the world. “After the remote study and telework period ended, we wanted to find a new tradition to celebrate SUA’s birthday,” said President Edward Feasel, after thanking some of the university leaders who planned the day’s events. “I hope this tradition of dialogue and community building will help us actualize the university’s mission.” Following Pres. Feasel’s remarks, alumni from around the world shared their reflections on video about the values they learned at Soka, including resilience, diversity, and caring, and how those values inform their lives today. Jenny Cook ’11 said she learned the importance of compassion through the “most incredible heart-to-heart dialogues” she had while on campus. As a learning behavior specialist in Chicago, it is something she relies on daily as she works with students of diverse backgrounds to bring equity to her practice. Dane Niemczura ’18 recalled the sincere and genuine caring he experienced on campus, and that the true expression of the values of global citizenship is “how we treat the person in front of us.” To answer the question posed in the title of his talk—“Is Community Possible?”—McDowell, professor of the practice of civic design at MIT’s Department of Urban Studies and Planning and associate director of civic design at the Center for Constructive Communication, began by digging into what it means to be in community. McDowell, whose work centers on design of civic infrastructures and processes to connect the increasingly demographically complex public, told the audience of about 160 people gathered in the Soka Performing Arts Center and online that the answer begins with refining the idea of community. McDowell, who is also co-host of WeWhoEngage, a podcast on civic design, referred to Carl Moore’s definition of community as existing when interdependent people “can peacefully struggle with the traditions that bind them and the interests that separate them,” in order to build a better future. Peaceful struggle, he said, is key to that understanding. “To step into differences and own them are not easy things,” McDowell said. Dialogue is crucial to the process of building community, but technology is changing how we speak to each other. While today’s technology allows for self-expression, it also means we have to confront what others are saying—a condition that can lead to trauma as so many of those online conversations are negative and triggering. “We are in these spaces in which we are very vulnerable and very sensitive,” McDowell said, and because the online environment is so toxic, participating in it can cause everyone to perpetuate it, even inadvertently. Noting that SUA is a place where dialogue is prized, McDowell challenged people to really “step into the practice,” and remove themselves from all us-vs.-them thinking. That includes thinking of groups such as faculty, staff, or students as separate, and approaching differences between them with a conflict mindset. “Escalating a problem may provide satisfaction as it helps people feel heard, but it can perpetuate separations,” he said. “You are more than that, more than immediate satisfaction.” Shifting to thinking in a way that respects both the individual and those in the community in situations may be the true definition of community, and requires people to “step into something where we see self-care as more than just ‘what I need’ right now, but self-care as ‘what we need together.’” Following his talk, small groups gathered outside the Soka Performing Arts Center to reflect on its themes. “What resonated with me the most was what he mentioned about building community with heart-to-heart conversation being frontier work,” said Emi Kuroda ‘23. “I believe that the world needs this type of community building more than ever and it can’t be achieved by repeating the past but by always exploring the potential of community and sincere dialogue starting with the person in front of us.” Sharing their thoughts in a small group format reinforced the importance of conversation, Kuroda said. “It was really nice and meaningful to see each other and talk in person because I felt a deep sense of community by getting to know more about people such as those who work at different offices on campus showing their care for the students and aspiring to contribute to the world.” Overall, attendees felt SUA’s birthday party was a success. Yuna Hasegawa ‘25 said they “loved how the event allowed students to connect with the staff who are supporting our college lives and get to know them better as a person through sharing each other’s experiences.”", "categories": ["Campus News"], "date_publish": "June 17, 2022", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

The 424-page comprehensive collection of SUA founder Daisaku Ikeda’s messages and writings for and about the university includes several essays; all 67 messages to SUA students from 2000 to 2021; and 11 of Ikeda’s lectures delivered at universities around the world, including Harvard, Moscow State University, and Teachers College, Columbia University. The committee members decided to create the book several months into the COVID-19 pandemic, when students everywhere were adapting to the new realities of online learning and social distancing. To commemorate SUA’s 20th anniversary, they set out to provide a comprehensive resource for the Soka community to learn about Soka Education, the founding spirit of SUA, and the university founder’s background and philosophy. Reflecting on the two-year process, committee member Subina Thapaliya ’22 said that reading through all of Ikeda’s essays, messages, and speeches as they assembled the book enabled her to draw strength and tackle many ongoing challenges. “I am grateful to have the golden opportunity to be part of such a significant, transformative project,” Thapaliya said. Writing in the book’s preface, the committee members explained their goal for the collection: “We earnestly hope that future SUA students will learn about the founding spirit and vision of Soka Education and develop SUA as young founders living a contributive life. It will be our great pleasure if this book is also read by the donors and supporters of SUA and young people around the world, inspiring them to further the cause of peace and justice in the 21st century.” The volume, in addition to Ikeda’s writings, includes SUA’s mission statement, values, mottos, and principles; the lyrics of “On the Path of Peace,” written and composed by students in 2008, and “The Light of Hope,” which was presented to SUA by Ikeda in 2011 to celebrate the university’s 10th anniversary; a comprehensive list of Ikeda’s university lectures and speeches; and a timeline of SUA’s history.", "categories": ["Campus News"], "date_publish": "June 16, 2022", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

What is the meaning of mathematics? Does a multiverse exist? Are we a part of a simulation? Those were some of the questions addressed by Brian Greene, the renowned theoretical physicist, in a conversation with Jim Merod, professor of American Literature at SUA, held in the Soka Performing Arts Center on April 29. Vice President for Academic Affairs Michael Weiner introduced Greene, who is professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University, chairman of the World Science Festival, and the author of several books, as dedicated “to enhancing public comprehension of the connection between science, philosophy, and the humanities.” Though his work grapples with complex topics of superstring theory, the Washington Post called Greene “the single best explainer of abstruse concepts in the world today.” This skill of elucidation was on full display at Soka as he introduced groundbreaking theories and questions in modern physics to an audience with varying levels of knowledge in physics. The conversation between Greene and Merod covered a variety of topics, including entanglement and wormholes, while also addressing their philosophical implications. Greene described biology, chemistry, mathematics, and quantum mechanics as languages we use to describe the universe, noting that some languages are more suitable for describing certain phenomena than others. For example, the motion of a ball, which is completely visible to us, is much better understood in classical physics, while it is easier to understand the behavior of tiny electrons using quantum mechanics. The conversation was followed by a question-and-answer session with the audience. One audience member asked if Greene believed in a creator, which fueled a vigorous discussion about reality and existence. Greene described religion as “a powerful means by which our species has metaphorically addressed some of the deep questions of mortality and meaning.” While he did not completely rule out the possibility of the existence of a creator, he requires concrete evidence to prove it. “The manner in which he combined physics with deeper questions about existence gave me many things to think about,” said Moses Odei Addai ’22, a reaction no doubt shared by many in the audience. —Nugnandini Chhetri ’25", "categories": ["Lectures, Undergraduate Program - BA, University-Wide", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "June 13, 2022", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

The recognition from UMN’s Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs is the 401th academic honor the 94-year-old Ikeda has received. Humphrey School Dean Nisha Botchwey introduced Ikeda’s life and contributions in her opening remarks, noting it would be “difficult to adequately describe a person of such extraordinary caliber and immense accomplishments.” Ikeda congratulated the UMN graduates in his acceptance message, praising them for braving the COVID-19 pandemic and overcoming numerous challenges. “The University of Minnesota was founded in 1851 on the noble conviction that all people are enriched by understanding,” Ikeda said. “The scale of the mission of today’s graduates, who will set out from today to confront an era of crisis with energy and momentum, is truly immeasurable.” The criteria for nominating and bestowing honorary degrees vary among universities. Recipients are usually not required to meet the typical requirements for a doctorate, such as completing required coursework, passing examinations, or defending a doctoral thesis. Rather, universities bestow such honors to recognize an individual’s lifetime achievements or outstanding contributions to society. At UMN, the honorary degree is the highest award conferred and may be awarded to individuals who have “achieved acknowledged eminence in cultural affairs, in public service, or in a field of knowledge and scholarship.” UNM’s website notes that honorary degrees are not awarded to encourage or reward financial contributions to the university. Ikeda joins a distinguished list of UMN honorary degree recipients, including US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright (’98); architect Frank Gehry (’99); Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa (’03); and poet and activist Maya Angelou (’07).", "categories": ["Campus News"], "date_publish": "June 17, 2022", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

{"newspaper": "soka-news", "url": "https://www.soka.edu/news-events/news/civil-rights-leader-whitney-youngs-fight-soul-america", "title": "Civil Rights Leader Whitney Young’s Fight for the Soul of America", "text": "In 2013, to mark the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, Michelle Obama held a White House screening of The Powerbroker: Whitney Young’s Fight for Civil Rights . She described the documentary as an opportunity to understand how much work goes into creating change, and called Young an unsung hero. The then First Lady also asked the audience to think about how each of them could become agents of change. In introducing the film to members of the SUA community gathered online to commemorate Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Professor of Latin American Studies Ian Olivo Read suggested they ask themselves the same question. That sentiment was echoed by Bonnie Boswell, the award-winning broadcast journalist and Young’s niece, during the discussion following the film. “This acclaimed and remarkable film documents Whitney Young’s extraordinary story, as the man in the middle between white and Black, rich and poor, during one of the most turbulent times in American history,” said Read. “Despite becoming a target of intense criticism from both white people and the Black power movement, Young helped erase African American stereotypes and opened opportunities for minorities that continue to influence diversity in America today.” During the Q&A session following the film, Boswell, currently the executive producer of Bonnie Boswell Reports on PBS, touched on Young’s place in the civil rights movement, his legacy, and her personal relationship with her uncle. Her first memory of him, she said, was when she was about six years old and visited his home in another state. He continued to reach out to her throughout his life. Boswell described the relationship between her uncle and MLK not only as partners and collaborators in the movement, but as family. “People understood and respected that everybody had a different role to play–Martin Luther King was in the pulpit and Whitney Young was in the boardrooms and Dorothy Height was taking care of communicating to women,” said Boswell. “They didn’t always get along like families don’t, but there was love, there was respect. And there was the idea that just like the parts of a watch, you need every single part to make the whole thing work.” Young was a social worker, and he brought that perspective to his work in the movement. He saw his role, Boswell said, as keeping people at the table. SUA Vice President of Mission Integration Kevin Moncrief, who co-moderated the discussion with Manager for Diversity Initiatives and Community Building Maya Gunaseharan, asked Boswell how Young and King exhibited SUA’s foundational qualities of wisdom, courage, and compassion. Boswell quoted both men regarding those virtues. Young, for example, said that “Every man is our brother, and every man’s burden is our own. Where poverty exists, all are poor. Where hate flourishes, all are corrupted. Where injustice rings, all are unequal.” That statement, Boswell said, encapsulated the movement leaders’ understanding of the interconnectedness of life. What we call the civil rights movement was “broader than just going from one part of the bus to the next,” she said, “it was about saving the soul of America.” “It is not a Black thing but an injustice thing, and so we have to really go broader than just seeing things on a skin-tone level, or gender level, but really on a basis of fairness and justice,” Boswell said. “That was kind of critical to both of their ways of thinking.” Both men exemplified courage by going “into the breach,” during a time in history that was extremely fractured and divisive. Young and King grew up at a point when Black people couldn’t eat in any restaurant they wanted to, for example. Boswell said Young knew he wasn’t always going to be liked, but thought the most important thing was to get something done. Boswell referred to MLK’s imaginative empathy as indicative of his compassion, as seen in his hopeful statement: “I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word.” Young, too, needed to call upon that quality to help him interpret Black power “in a way that the threatened white community could embrace it.” “Young said, ‘Black power simply means look at me,’ ” she said. “‘I’m here, I have dignity, I have pride, I have roots. I insist, I demand that I participate in those decisions that affect my life and the lives of my children. It means that I am somebody.’” In response to a question about what advice she’d offer SUA students, Boswell said the first step is for them to become educated citizens. “Education is critical to being able to develop a compassionate population,” she said. Without it, people can easily become biased and constructive dialogue is impossible. Boswell said it was important for Americans to “really get involved in the spirit of the country,” and advocate for the things that most speak to their hearts. “We have a mission that each of us can do uniquely,” she said. “Whitney Young and Martin Luther King were able to go from the world they grew up in to moving the ball forward, so they’ve handed this off to us, to you.”", "categories": ["REHR Center"], "date_publish": "February 09, 2022", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

{"newspaper": "soka-news", "url": "https://www.soka.edu/news-events/news/karamo-brown-critical-conversations-soka", "title": "Karamo Brown in Critical Conversations @Soka", "text": "Karamo Brown, three-time Emmy winner and culture expert on the Netflix reboot of Queer Eye, spoke at the Critical Conversations @Soka event on Feb. 19. The Critical Conversations series aims to ignite conversation, connect community, and transform personal, local, and global issues in a positive way. Brown shared the stage with Michael Hyter, an author, public speaker, and global organizational leadership consultant who was named one of “The Most Influential Blacks in Corporate America” by Savoy Magazine in 2018. During the interview Brown explained how he reconciled his Christian faith with his sexuality as a black, openly gay man. By age 12 Brown said he knew he was gay, which made growing up in a homophobic household difficult. But after studying the Bible, he realized that many of the verses used as rhetoric against homosexuality were taken out of context. Confident that he was on the right path, and despite a difficult relationship with his father, Brown persevered and thrived. He is now a successful author, father, social worker, TV star, and podcast host, offering advice to people around the world on challenging situations affecting their lives. One of his key messages is the importance of listening with empathy. “I’ve become a better parent by being an empathetic listener,” he said.”I listen more than I speak, and I try to really listen to my kids, and understand what they’re saying, what they’re going through. “When my kids come to me to talk about their issues, the first question I ask them – and this is something that’s not just for parents but also for any relationship you’re engaging with, whether it’s at work, in your intimate relationship, or in friendships – is I say ‘You’re sharing. Are you just wanting for me to listen? Or do you want advice?’” “Comparison is the thief of joy”: In response to Hyter’s question about how he got to where he is today, Karamo said that he tries to keep in mind the mantra “Comparison is the thief of joy.” Constantly judging yourself in comparison to others is unhealthy and detrimental to your own happiness and success. On living your dream: “If it wasn’t for my son asking me if I was living my dreams, and then me doing the work to challenge my fears, I wouldn’t be sitting in front of you today,” he said. “Life throws us curveballs, and in that moment we can either be afraid of it, or we can say ‘You know what? I’m gonna embrace this.’ And one of the biggest things I learned was that embracing the things that we’re scared of and asking for help is actually where you find the most growth and [you] get closer to what you want and deserve.” On race: “What can white people do to educate their kids about race in our country?” The first step: “Google it! …The first step is taking 15 minutes out of your day to just Google something.” The second step: “Continue that conversation in spaces where people of color aren’t around.… Pretend that someone you love [who’s of color] is at the table and think about ‘What is something that they might want you to bring up?’ The conversation doesn’t always need to be two hours or deep, but if you at least bring up the conversation, it becomes part of your everyday conversation instead of just being something you only talk about when there’s something traumatic or dramatic in the news.” The third step: “It’s important to invite people of color into your spaces. If your university, your neighborhood is all white, it’s important for you to say, ‘I need to be taking my kids out of this space to be around other people of color so that they can learn.’ And not just have it be something where it’s once a week, but make sure you’re actively putting them around people of color because that’s where you learn the empathy.” Prior to the event Karamo made himself available to the campus community for hugs, handshakes, high-fives and photo opportunities at a reception in the Black Box Theatre co-hosted by the Soka LGBTeam. By the end of the evening he was so uplifted by the campus experience, he said he was going to invite his son, who is currently researching colleges, to tour SUA. —by Nagisa Smalheiser ‘21", "categories": ["REHR Center", "Critical Conversations", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "February 21, 2020", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Spillers as its Distinguished Visiting Faculty Fellow. Dr. Spillers, Gertrude Conaway Vanderbilt Professor of English at Vanderbilt University, collaborated with center staff, which includes co-directors Kevin Moncrief, vice president for Mission Integration, and Associate Professor of Latin American Studies Ian Read, as well as its newly appointed student and faculty fellows and executive host, Vice President for Academic Affairs Michael Weiner, to develop the center’s mission statement. The REHR Center’s immediate priorities include assisting the university with the recently announced search for a presidential hire of a professor of Black Studies , a senior-level position that will help the effort to create a new program in Race and Ethnic Studies, assisting the Faculty Forum in developing academic programming focused on race and ethnicity, and developing programming for the community-at-large. SUA President Ed Feasel originally announced the formation of the REHR Center in July 2020, along with a number of other initiatives, including the development of the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and the 20th anniversary project. Prof. Read explained that President Feasel “created the parameters of possibility and within them we see the vision. But that requires the fellows, the students, and the faculty. What we are trying to do is not top-down.” To that end, the center will have up to three faculty and three student fellows each year. The inaugural faculty fellows, who were chosen for their expertise and experience, are Nidanie Henderson-Stull, assistant professor of biochemistry, and Lisa MacLeod, associate professor of International Studies. The inaugural student fellows are student body president Shunji Fueki ’21, who is able to serve as an elected representative of the students, and Vibhu Walia ’22. One student fellowship, offered to the Black Student Union, whose organizing efforts were instrumental in highlighting the need for the center, currently remains open. “I don’t think any organization, center, effort, or program will reach its potential and confront the problems of racism or strive towards a more equitable world in which human rights are respected without the voice of Black Americans,” Prof. Read said, “and as a center in the US, we need the voices of diverse Black Americans. “But I also have to emphasize that Soka is a global university with a global mission and we have been called on by our founder to see fellowship in global humanity, which is also what the center is trying to do.” For example, Fueki, a student fellow, is working with Prof. MacLeod to organize a topic on statelessness—the condition of not having an officially recognized nationality—as a human rights issue. The emphasis on both local and global human rights also aligns with the university’s effort to recommit to its founding principles . “Race has been a problem in every single country, but people don’t know about it,” Moncrief said. “Part of being a global citizen is imaginative empathy, and we have the opportunity to inform those who wouldn’t have any idea.” The center is developing programming with guidance from leading scholars in the field. “One thing I like to think about, when we think about companies out there, is that it’s very hard to name one older than 50 and those that do exist have changed over time, but it’s not hard to name at least 10 universities older than 200 years,” Prof. Read said. “To think that convention or a program can be created in one or two years makes us forget that SUA will be here in 200 years and that’s humbling. We are trying to build something that will outlive us and that takes patience, real deliberation, and care.” Nevertheless, the center has moved relatively quickly, with support for two new courses taught this year by professors MacLeod and Henderson-Stull. Its top priority is the collaborative development of new courses related to issues of race, ethnicity, and human rights, and a new professor of Black Studies will be an important step in program building. “When you talk about things as entrenched as racism or sexism,” Moncrief said, “the way to start to turn the tide the other way is to create institutions that live on and educate people regardless of their background.” As the REHR Center works on its long-term mission and takes its first steps to create and sustain dialogue in the Soka community in the short term, it aims to develop rich programming to learn from diverse human rights leaders on what it takes to become global citizens committed to justice. The center’s inaugural event with Ambassador Young and Dr. Spillers “was the first of what will be thousands of dialogues,” Moncrief said. Another discussion, “Halfway Home: Race, Punishment and the Afterlife of Mass Incarceration” with Dr. Reuben Jonathan Miller and Jhody Polka, was held on February 16. Next up, on March 3, is “Fearing and Desiring of Black Women, A Book Talk on ‘Imagining the Mulatta: Blackness in US and Brazilian Media,’” with Dr. Jasmine Mitchell .", "categories": ["DEI", "REHR Center", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "February 18, 2021", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

The next day, they met executive directors, presidents, and CEOs at a virtual career fair. Nina Battioni ’25 said the networking event was a good opportunity to meet many employers. “I went in looking for a possible job to start this summer, and I was lucky enough to get one through the recruiters I met there,” Battioni said. Organized by SUA’s Career Services and Internships Office, the events were among the university’s recent efforts to bolster career networking opportunities for students. President Ed Feasel spoke at the networking happy hour to an audience of students and representatives from the for-profit and nonprofit worlds, including University Lab Partners, Festival of Arts/Pageant of the Masters, and Scientific Horizons Consulting. He emphasized the role of Soka education in developing students’ critical thinking and communication skills, preparing them for a future as leaders of the 21st century. “After graduation, 70% of our students don’t go to grad school immediately,” Pres. Feasel said. “They go to work. Many of our alumni, quickly after they join a company, move into leadership roles.” After exchanging LinkedIn profiles, resumes, and business cards at the networking happy hour, students reserved time slots to meet with any of the 27 companies that participated in the virtual career fair the following day, including Hoag Hospital, Human Resources Services for the County of Orange, and the US Department of State. The online format enabled students to attend employer information sessions for companies based both in and outside California. Those who wanted to speak to employers individually were able to sign up for one-on-one sessions. Mahir Anand ’25 encouraged Soka students looking to make connections in their field of interest to attend similar networking events in the future. “The event provided a community of togetherness, which helped me build on my social skills,” Anand said. “It also gave me an excellent opportunity to network with like-minded individuals.” For more information about future Soka networking events, visit the Career Development webpage or contact Jonathan Wray at jwray@soka.edu . —Lilia Benavides Medina ’24", "categories": ["Campus News"], "date_publish": "July 14, 2022", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

It works to bolster the economic health and business practices of higher education institutions nationwide. NACUBO President and CEO Susan Whealler shared in a press release that the organization takes great pride in honoring outstanding role models for higher education. “Their contributions are demonstrations of sound higher education fiscal management that we can all learn from, and we are so glad they are NACUBO members,” Whealler said. Asawa was one of seven business and finance leaders and two universities that received NACUBO awards in categories recognizing endowment management, excellence in sustainability, and service, among others. His contributions to the higher education community are longstanding and varied, serving as a member of the NACUBO board of directors; as president and board member of WACUBO; and as a member and chair of the Small Institutions Council. Asawa has helped guide NACUBO’s content programming and offered expertise to its Fellows and New Business Officers Programs. Asked about the significance of the award, Asawa said it transcends recognition for his efforts alone. “Through this volunteer work, many college and university business officers were able to gain an appreciation about Soka and our mission and values,” Asawa said.", "categories": ["Campus News"], "date_publish": "August 04, 2022", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

{"newspaper": "soka-news", "url": "https://www.soka.edu/news-events/news/renaissance-begins-critical-conversation-simon-mainwaring", "title": "The Renaissance Begins: A Critical Conversation with Simon Mainwaring", "text": "To anyone feeling hopeless about the many crises facing humanity, brand futurist and author Simon Mainwaring believes that taking intentional, collective action is the antidote. In “Rewiring Capitalism,” the first lecture in the Critical Conversations series held on campus in more than two years, Mainwaring sounded a call for individuals, leaders, and businesses to come together to transform capitalism and tackle environmental destruction. Despite the seriousness of the topic, Mainwaring left the audience gathered in the Black Box Theatre at Soka Performing Arts Center on March 16 with a sense of hope as well as steps they can begin taking in their daily lives to create change. “I deeply believe in the innate goodness of humanity and I don’t think we’re going to allow ourselves to go out of business,” Mainwaring said. “We had to get to this acute moment of urgency before we were going to pay attention.” The evening’s theme of reimagining capitalism was well suited to Critical Conversations, a lecture series designed to bring changemakers to campus “to ignite conversation,” said Director of Special Projects Mary Patrick Kavanaugh, who founded Critical Conversations in 2014. “We invite thought leaders from around the world, from across sectors and perspectives, who want to solve issues through dialogue,” Kavanaugh said. Those speakers have included Mohamed El-Erian, Henry Rollins, Anna Deavere Smith, Brian Greene, and Karamo Brown. The series is also an opportunity for Soka to expand its presence in the community and to partner with organizations addressing the social issues raised by speakers. The Daisaku and Kaneko Ikeda Library also builds a resource guide for many of the Critical Conversations events, allowing students to do a deeper dive into the issues. With Soka students interested in both global citizenship and mission-driven organizations, Kavanaugh wanted to bring two leaders in purpose-driven businesses to campus for the spring 2022 event. Mainwaring is the founder of We First, a creative consulting company that works with CEOs, CMOs, and entrepreneurs, and the author of Lead with We and We First , a NY Times bestseller. Following his talk, Mainwaring was joined on stage by Gail Becker, the founder of Cailipower, which makes affordable, gluten-free cauliflower-based foods. Although purpose-driven companies—those with a social or environmental mission built into their business model—have become more common in the last decade and traditional businesses are increasingly examining their impact on the climate and social good, Mainwaring noted that the vast majority of business is unchanged. “While those points of light are increasing, what’s missing is the connective tissue between those efforts so that they compound,” he said. Mainwaring detailed the idea of a virtuous spiral in which the actions taken by everyone in society—individuals, companies, and leaders—combine to create enough of an impact that transformation can occur. That spiral begins with recognizing that each person has contributed to the problems society must solve, and then changing mindsets, processes, and aspirations. Mainwaring urged audience members “to be much more intentional” as consumers and pay attention to what they buy, where they bank and invest, and where they work. Every employee in every business must also ask what they can do through their work to create change. In turn, that shift in consumer behavior and expectations will force companies to make changes if they want to survive. “The luxury of choosing how far and how fast you are going to change,” he said, “and what you are going to do, is over as people aren’t going to buy from, work for, or invest in companies that are not solving our problems.” Becker, who was a broadcast journalist and a communications strategist before starting her company in 2016, noted that people sometimes misunderstand the goals of companies that put building social and environmentality responsibility in the forefront. Leading with purpose is not a threat to capitalism or a dismissal of it, but its next phase. “It is really the belief that capitalism needs to evolve,” Becker said, “because the conditions we’ve created by the practice of capitalism up until now are threatening our survival, and we need to do something different.” Noting that Mainwaring had ended his talk on a hopeful note, Becker asked him how he stayed optimistic. On the other side of the pain and uncertainty, he said, is a world in which capitalism works with the natural world instead of destroying it, and regenerates itself through the abundance inherent in the environment. “I don’t actually see this as the end of something,” Mainwaring said. “I see this as the beginning of the most miraculous renaissance of business that we’ve ever seen.”", "categories": ["Bridges to Business", "Critical Conversations", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "April 04, 2022", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Once they saw the quality and the boldness of Soka University of America’s vision, Harder’s company contacted its founders with a proposal. They would get the permissions SUA needed in only a few months if it moved the campus to Aliso Viejo. SUA’s founding team agreed that the hilltop setting was perfect, and Harder soon accepted an offer to become the university’s seventh employee. Joining SUA when the campus was still a pile of blueprints and a patch of dirt, albeit with gorgeous views, was “an incredible opportunity to do something new and watch a new university grow from the very beginning,” Harder said. On February 25, she will retire after 24 years guiding community relations and marketing for SUA. As director of community relations, Harder has led several major projects within the university and with external organizations, including launching the popular Soka International Festival. She also served on the board of directors at several local organizations. The community ties Harder developed before joining SUA and that she has nurtured in the years since have greatly benefited SUA, said Vice President of Finance and Administration Arch Asawa. “Wendy has been pivotal in building strong relations with our local government entities, chambers of commerce, community organizations, and media outlets,” Asawa said. To recognize her exemplary service to the university, President Ed Feasel presented Harder with the Soka University Award of Honor and medal during her final week on campus. The certificate, signed by Pres. Feasel and university founder Daisaku Ikeda, states: “In recognition of the dedicated contributions you have made to the development of Soka University of America through your activities to promote world peace and to enrich human culture, and your deep understanding and appreciation of the founding spirit of Soka University of America, we hereby present you with this award.” Harder, who also received a personal note from Mr. Ikeda and his wife Kaneko, is the first retiring employee to be honored with the award. Harder easily recalled her first day with SUA. She remembered sitting around a table with the six other employees, who asked her to help with the brochure they needed to begin recruiting SUA’s first class. Harder’s request to see the college’s mission statement drew blank stares. “They had this vision for this wonderful campus and all the things that they were going to be able to do and create, but nobody had written down how we were going to describe SUA yet,” Harder said. The team got to work defining student-teacher ratios and average class sizes—all the specifics Harder needed to begin marketing the school. Once they researched Mr. Ikeda’s vision for the school, the problem of a mission statement was solved. “The idea of fostering a steady stream of global citizens committed to living a contributive life was so simple and so perfect,” Harder said. Another dilemma soon popped up. A brochure marketing a school needs pictures of students, but SUA was three years away from having any on campus. Harder didn’t believe in using stock photography, so the team began speaking to high school sophomores about SUA and invited those who expressed interest to tour the grounds and appear in the brochure. Harder still thinks fondly of SUA’s first class of 120 undergraduate students who first walked onto campus in 2001. “They applied not knowing if construction was going to be complete or if the school would even get accredited,” she said. “They were pioneers. They were the ones who were brave enough to want to be part of something new.” Of all the events and projects she’s run through the years, Harder named the International Festival as a favorite. From its inception as a celebration of SUA’s first anniversary—with students from campus clubs performing everything from multicultural dance to hip hop to jazz; selling food, artwork, and crafts; and featuring local non-profits—the festival has grown to a beloved event drawing thousands of people. “The festival was a major way for a lot of people who would never have seen the campus to visit, and it has given us a lot of partnership opportunities with community groups,” Harder said. Director of Philanthropy Linda Kennedy agreed that the festival Harder launched “has become one of Orange County’s most talked-about events and will live forever in the history of SUA.” In addition to her many contributions to SUA and Aliso Viejo, Harder’s colleagues said they will miss her presence on campus. Working with Harder, Kennedy said, “has been a true delight.” “Wendy has left an indelible mark on the university with the programs and relationships she’s created over the years and her special ability to connect Soka to the community and welcome the community to campus,” Kennedy said. Asawa, who has worked with Harder since SUA’s early days, noted that she is known on campus and beyond for her sharp wit and communication skills. “I have truly admired and will especially miss her calm, steadying demeanor and unfailing optimism and positivity over the past nearly two and a half decades,” Asawa said. “I will greatly miss Wendy as she has been a part of my Soka experience from day one.” As she cleaned out an office filled with artifacts collected through the years, such as UN flags used at graduations, Harder expressed appreciation for her SUA colleagues. While much has changed from the early days when the staff and faculty worked together in the library, Harder said she was most impressed by their ongoing, shared commitment to SUA’s vision. Lights in Founders Hall, where she has her office, are often burning late into the night or early in the morning. “There’s so much personal commitment from the staff and faculty for the benefit of the students,” she said. “And it’s been so fun to watch our students after graduation and see what they’re doing in the world.” Harder, who plans to begin her retirement with a white-water rafting trip, described SUA as a wonderful place to work. “It’s such a supportive environment,” she said. “People listen to each other and together figure out the best way to do things. I’ve been very blessed.”", "categories": ["Campus News"], "date_publish": "February 25, 2022", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Held in commemoration of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the webinar featured two esteemed panelists: Ambassador Andrew J. Young, civil rights activist, former congressman from Georgia and ambassador to the United Nations, and confidant to Martin Luther King Jr.; and Dr. Hortense J. Spillers, American literary critic, Black feminist scholar, and Gertrude Conaway Vanderbilt Professor at Vanderbilt University, who also currently serves as the Distinguished Visiting Faculty Fellow for the REHR Center . The panelists shared anecdotes and advice on how Dr. King’s philosophy of nonviolence can be implemented today, especially at the university level, to address racism and division in the US and world. “I think Dr. King would be very, very proud of the sensitivity of Black and white. He would be proud that people as far as New Zealand and Africa were mobilized by George Floyd’s death,” Ambassador Young said in his opening remarks, referring to how much faster mobilization is now compared to during the civil rights movement. “I think he would also, though, be concerned that it’s not disciplined enough, that we were very careful to keep a purely nonviolent demonstration, [which] is far more powerful than either a violent demonstration or a demonstration that is tainted with episodes of violence.” Dr. Spillers echoed those thoughts and called for a conscious approach to change. “I think that the challenge before all of us—and I’m saying that because I feel no particular wisdom or superiority in age to young people in society today—what we’re up against now is what the world was still confronting when Martin Luther King started his movement,” Dr. Spillers said. “And that is a mandate to be conscious, the mandate to be aware.” Both speakers noted that when confronting these challenges, learning from global, historical examples is paramount. Ultimately, nonviolence is a way of life rather than a tactic, and requires individual discipline as evidenced by the philosophy of satyagraha advocated by Mohandas K. Gandhi and adopted by Dr. King. “For instance, if you think of the ways that racism works, it really is a projection, right?” Dr. Spillers continued. “It’s a projection outward of something that one does not accept in oneself so that if you project it outward onto somebody else, or onto another group of people, you can live with yourself. Don’t do it. It’s an evacuation. Self-hatred is really an evacuation.” By contrast, through practicing self-love and self-discipline, we can extend acceptance outwards, Dr. Spillers explained. A key takeaway of the discussion that both speakers alluded to was that the university is an apt training ground to develop such love and discipline. “Naturally, Martin Luther King Jr., his legacy and his work are so aligned with everything SUA stands for and in particular what SUA’s founder stands for and expects of the global citizens SUA aims to foster,” said Maya Gunaseharan, Soka’s manager for diversity initiatives and community building, who was one of the event’s moderators. “The question that came up around the role of the university in achieving social justice, which Dr. Spillers responded to from the perspective of faculty who serve students and Ambassador Young responded to in terms of what students can do every day—it’s only just the beginning.” “Dealing with racism and learning to love means learning to appreciate differences,” Ambassador Young said, placing particular emphasis on university campuses being the place to begin to do this. “I think everybody on this planet is lonely. In fact, one of the biggest worries I have about present-day education is that…students don’t speak to each other.” He encouraged SUA students to make it a point to say hello to everyone they meet. “Make that a ritual, if you want to do something to make me and Martin Luther King happy. Every time you go into the classroom, say good morning or good afternoon to whoever the teacher is and then whoever you sit next to, if you don’t know their name, say hi… that’s the beginning of community.” “I think the university is responsible—and this might not even be fair—but I think that the university is always responsible for whatever state society is in,” Dr. Spillers said. “I don’t think of the university as an ivory tower at all. I think that if you look at a society and the different relations that grow out of a society, find out what’s going on in the universities, because it’s out of our colleges and universities that everything else concerning public education or the education of a populace…comes.” Said Ambassador Young: “From what I have learned from you about Soka, that you have the world on your campus, that you probably have more people from more nations than are present in the United Nations at any one time, you have an extremely valuable opportunity to get to know the world.” The discussion was co-facilitated by Gunaseharan, Kevin Moncrief, Soka’s vice president for Mission Integration, and Ian Reed, co-director, with Moncrief, of the REHR Center. The purpose of the event, which is the first of many that the center hopes to host regularly, was to open an ongoing discussion and inquiry into how to implement Soka’s ideals by learning from the examples of prominent human rights leaders.

Featured in the award-winning documentary, Pray the Devil Back to Hell , Nobel Peace Laureate Leymah Gbowee is best known for leading a nonviolent movement that brought together Christian and Muslim women to play a pivotal role in ending Liberia’s devastating, 14-year civil war in 2003. This historic achievement paved the way for the election of Africa’s first female head of state, Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.  Gbowee, Sirleaf and Tawakkul Karman were awarded the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize “for their nonviolent struggle for the safety of women and for women’s rights to full participation in peace-building work.” A trained social worker and women’s rights advocate, Ms. Gbowee is the founder and president of Gbowee Peace Foundation Africa-USA, founded in 2012 in Monrovia, Liberia, which provides educational and leadership opportunities to girls, women and the youth in Liberia. Gbowee is also the former executive director of the Women Peace and Security Network Africa, based in Ghana, which builds relationships across the West African sub-region in support of women’s capacity to prevent, avert, and end conflicts. She is a founding member and former coordinator of the Women in Peacebuilding Program/West African Network for Peacebuilding. She also served as the commissioner-designate for the Liberia Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Gbowee serves on the board of directors of the Nobel Women’s Initiative and the PeaceJam Foundation, and in 2013, she became an Oxfam Global ambassador. She serves as a sustainable development goals advocate for the United Nations and as a member of the World Refugee Council. In 2017 Gbowee was selected to serve on the United Nations Secretary-General’s High Level Advisory Board. “We’re very proud that Soka University is welcoming Leymah Gbowee back to campus,” added Dr. Habuki, noting that she spoke on “Outrageous Acts of Peace” on a previous visit in 2014. “Our mission is to foster a steady stream of global citizens committed to living a contributive life.

Just as many of you have expressed, I am also shocked and angered by this unprovoked attack on a sovereign nation. War is diametrically opposed to Soka’s proud pacifist heritage and our commitment to peace. It is ordinary people who suffer the most during war—mothers, children, the elderly, non-combatant citizens—and thus I strongly reiterate the international community’s calls for de-escalation and an immediate withdrawal of Russian troops. This unprovoked invasion comes at a time when so many people around the world are still dealing with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Our mission as a university to foster global citizens imbued with wisdom, courage, and compassion is more urgent than ever. Rather than give in to the despair wrought by war, let’s deepen our commitment to our purpose at Soka to become people capable of transforming the roots of conflict and injustice in our world. Let’s continue to pursue our shared commitment to work across boundaries and divides and shift society away from selfish competition, exploitation, and war toward humanistic competition, collaboration, and peace. In his 40th annual Peace Proposal to the United Nations published earlier this month, our university founder Daisaku Ikeda encouraged the global community to reject division and use the shared challenge of the global pandemic to create a “consciousness of solidarity that extends to the entire world.” We don’t have to be diplomats or world leaders to engage in this critical grassroots work. Each of us can strengthen the consciousness of solidarity with each other on campus as we work to become role models of fostering peace in our community. I recognize that students, faculty, and staff may be affected by this conflict, as some of us have friends and family living in Russia and Ukraine. Other members of our community may have traumatic personal and familial experiences of war, conflict, and displacement. Watching war unfold, even from thousands of miles away, may evoke painful feelings and memories. The Soka community is here to support you. If you see friends who are struggling, encourage them to seek support. Students can receive counseling support on campus by making an appointment via counseling@soka.edu , off campus by emailing noblelmft@gmail.com or get immediate support by contacting a counselor 24 hours a day at My SSP.  Students should also feel free to reach out to our Dean of Students, Hyon Moon, for assistance. For faculty and staff who would like support, we have an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) through Aetna Resources of Living. The EAP has short-term counseling available. Employees can call to speak to someone directly. For additional information please feel free to contact our Vice President for Human Resources and Risk Management, Katherine King. Fundamentally, war is a violation of the sanctity of life. Let us always treasure each member of our community: at SUA, in our city and county, nation, and globally.

Children of immigrants is one of the controversial outcomes of global labor demand and migration. In this talk, Chavez examines the discourse surrounding “anchor babies,” language used to justify exclusionary public policies and attempts to redefine citizenship. This could render a new category of U.S. born/non-citizens as a possible caste in American society, thereby fostering an “insiders vs. outsiders” environment, and ultimately worsening the stigma already experienced by today’s undocumented immigrants. Professor Chavez’s research examines various issues related to transnational migration, immigrants and medical care, cultural models of cancer risk factors, and media constructions of the “immigrant” and the “nation.” He is the author of many books including The Latino Threat: Constructing Immigrants, Citizens, and the Nation and Shadowed Lives: Undocumented Immigrants in American Society, which provides an ethnographic account of Mexican and Central American undocumented immigrants in San Diego, CA.", "categories": ["REHR Center", "PBRC"], "date_publish": "March 04, 2014", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Mayor Ross Chun and Mayor Pro Tem Richard Hurt presented SUA President Edward M. Feasel and Archibald E. Asawa, vice president for finance and administration, with a certificate of recognition in February. Pres. Feasel acknowledged the award at a city council meeting. “We cherish our shared history since 2001 when Soka opened our doors to students from our first graduating class, which is also the same year that the city of Aliso Viejo was incorporated,” Pres. Feasel said in remarks at the meeting. “Over the years, Soka has continued to serve as a great resource for our local community, most recently partnering with the city and county as a major Point of Distribution center established during the initial days of Covid vaccine distribution.” “I am happy to report that all classes are now conducted in-person on our campus,” Pres. Feasel continued. “We are also beginning to open-up our campus in the various ways that we serve the community. Youth, who swim with the local swim club Novaquatics, that trains at our pool, returned to Soka last September, and we plan to welcome hundreds of youth once again to our annual summer camps this June and July. Community groups who use our facilities for their activities, have been able to do so since late last year in some of our peripheral buildings and we will expand this to other internal buildings over the next several months. “As an institution that prides itself on the importance of community, locally, nationally, and globally, we are very proud of all these relationships and venues we have created for serving residents of the city of Aliso Viejo and we look forward to our continued partnership and collaboration together in the future.”", "categories": ["Campus News"], "date_publish": "February 28, 2022", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

As students returned to campus this fall, Lion athletes resumed practice and competitions. It was not easy to maintain good academic results while competing during a pandemic with its restrictive measures. However, SUA athletes worked hard to overcome these obstacles and earned many prestigious recognitions. “I am so proud of how the Soka student-athletes and staff have persevered during this challenging time,” Director of Athletics and Recreation Mike Moore said, “having to endure continuous testing and scanning before competitions and practice, all with the goal of representing their university.” Let’s celebrate and take a look at the achievements of the Lions athletic teams so far this year. Four women’s soccer players were named to the All-California Pacific Conference team. Cienna Irwin ‘25, a stalwart at central defense, and tenacious forward Araceli Soto-Garcia ‘23 earned spots on the second team. Ashley Bustamante ‘22 and Alex Bershtein ‘24 received honorable mentions. Five men’s soccer players were named all conference. Striker Gera De La Torre ‘22 was named to the first team and central defender Chase Buchert ‘23 the second team. Riley Grosso ‘22, Noah Alexander ‘24, and Luis Barraza ‘25 earned honorable mentions. The Soka Lions produced program-best results at the Arizona Christian Firestorm Fall Invitational at Verrado Golf Club, near Phoenix. On Day 1 of the competition, Emi Brown ‘25, Kalen Yamamoto ‘25, Savanna Smith ‘23, and Kennah Watts ‘22 combined to shoot 373, improving to a 360 on Day 2, for a two-day total of 733. Brown led the Lions, shooting 86 and 83, while Yamamoto shot 94 and 82. Each Lion player shot better than 100 in the second round, marking the first time in program history that the whole team broke 100. Smith shot 96 and Watts 99. The swim program set two school records, and posted multiple personal-best times in the Pacific Collegiate Swim Conference championship meet, February 16-19 in St. George, Utah. The men’s relay team of AJ Stewart ’25, Sean Li ’24, Zachary Holt ’25, and Josh Beam ’25 set SUA records in the 200- and 400-yard medley relays. The team finished sixth in the 200-medley relay in 1:36.99 and seventh in the 400-medley relay in 3:38.91, the school-record times qualifying them for a spot in the NAIA National Championship meet March 2-5 in Columbus, Ga. Holt, who this season broke the school-record in the 100 and 200 breaststroke, and Stewart have also qualified as individuals for nationals. In January, SUA honored seniors from the class of 2022, including Mikiko Hashimoto, Sophia Greco, Lisa Ransom, Sydney Sansbury, Yoshki Wurtz, and the late Wyatt Balman, during a dual meet against Westcliff University. Sydney Sansbury ’22 swam a season-best 18:33.36 in the 1650 freestyle, 18th in the NAIA. In December, Stewart ‘25 and Sophia Greco ‘22 were named Pacific Collegiate Swim and Dive Conference NAIA Swimmers of the Week for their performances at the University of Puget Sound Logger Invitational. Greco swam strong races in the 200 individual medley relay (2:21.66). She also competed in the 200-yard backstroke (2:13.18) and the 100-yard butterfly. The men’s and women’s teams each finished fifth at the California Pacific Conference Championships in November at Woodward Park in Fresno. In the men’s 8K race, Naoki Kasai ‘25 finished 20th in 27:32.4. Jordan Bravo ‘25 finished in 28:09.7, followed by Randal Lindenmayer ‘23 (30:10.6), Kory Brown ‘24 (31:04.6), Adrian Echavarria ‘24 (32:11.5), Ryota Kamiuchi ‘22 (32:56.0), Gudy Castillo ‘23 (34:02.9), and Kofi Sarkodie ‘22 (35:08.3). In the women’s 5K race, Naomi Otsuka ‘22 finished 19th in 20:52.0. Miranda Lam ‘24 (21:54.7) finished 25th, followed by Hiromi Hashide ‘24 (23:08.2), Monica Donayre ‘24 (23:16.2), Wendy Wimmer ‘22 (24:02.7), Clam Belisle ‘22 (24:45.8), and Vitoria Robles ‘25 (25:20.3). The track and field program hosted their seventh-annual indoor qualifier meet this month. Dylan Fox ’25 and Olivia Chung ‘24 set school records. Fox won the long jump, posting a 6.94-meter (22 feet 9.25 inch) mark. Chung was fifth in the 60-meter hurdles in 9.78 seconds, to break her own school record she set earlier in February. —Thuy Le ‘22", "categories": ["Campus News"], "date_publish": "February 25, 2022", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},
{"newspaper": "soka-news", "url": "https://www.soka.edu/news-events/news/message-community-president-edward-m-feasel", "title": "A Message to the Community From President Edward M. Feasel", "text": "Dear Soka Community, May 3, 2021, will mark the 20th Annivers​ary of the Soka University of America, Aliso Viejo campus. This August, we will be launching our year-long 20th anniversary project under the theme, “Soka Global Citizens: Embodying Wisdom, Courage, and Compassion.” Our University Founder, Daisaku Ikeda, in his 1996 Teachers College, Columbia University address, defined these essential elements of global citizens to be: These three attributes of global citizens, while innate in our lives, unfortunately are often not the traits we see most prevalently displayed in society, where instead self-centered material satisfaction and expansion are the focus. It is in our efforts to become global citizens, while pursuing our own personal growth and advancement, that we seek to develop that aspect of our lives that represents our greater selves, an awareness of and a connection to a larger body, community, and society. Becoming a global citizen is a journey of personal growth and inner transformation. This includes an ethical and spiritual dimension of service and responsibility to each other, while mastering our lesser egocentric selves. Just as we are taught to become human in so many ways, such as accumulating knowledge and learning tradition and culture, education should also foster an ethical and spiritual quest of what it means to be human and to be part of a global community. Mr. Ikeda further shared in his Teachers College address, “Education is a uniquely human privilege. It is the source of inspiration that enables us to become fully and truly human.” This type of education is essential if we are to avoid and overcome the social ills and environmental degradation and destruction that we bear witness to today. With the goal of recommitting to the founding principles and spirit upon which SUA was founded, the Board of Trustees has created a new Trustee Professorship in Ikeda Studies. The trustee professor will be engaged in teaching and research on Daisaku Ikeda Studies. The trustee professor will teach classes both at the general education and concentration levels in the undergraduate program and in a specific class in the graduate program. The trustee professor shall also undertake special assignments, as identified by the president or by the trustees, in strengthening and expanding the inclusion of Daisaku Ikeda Studies in various parts of the university’s curricular and extracurricular programming. This position will also oversee potential collaborations with the growing number of institutions in the US and abroad engaging in Daisaku Ikeda studies. We look forward to filling this position in the near future. I will also be establishing a steering committee for the year-long 20th Anniversary Project that I will personally chair, with appointed representatives from students, staff, faculty, administration, alumni, and the Board. The steering committee will lead a campus-wide discussion and effort on inculcating the founding principles and spirit into the culture of our community. The project will emphasize several aspects that make SUA unique: I want to also thank the Sohokai, our wonderful alumni organization, for their commitment to financially support several campus projects centering on recommitting to our founding principles. These projects include a new visitors room on the first floor of Founders Hall, sharing the history of SUA and Soka Education; the establishment of the Founder’s Meeting room on the third floor of Founders Hall, which will be named after Daisaku Ikeda; a new Peace Grove seating area where the eucalyptus trees stand outside the student center; and a new reception and casual meeting place in the current guest residence, which is located in the back part of campus. It is only due to the generosity of our alumni that we can make these significant changes to our campus as we celebrate our 20th anniversary. As we embark on our 20th anniversary year, we have been horrified and appalled by the extent to which racism remains embedded in our society, as reflected in the unjustified killing of Black people. It is important now more than ever to concretely challenge the racist actions and prejudices that exist in our society. At SUA we have taken campus initiatives including, but not limited to, providing mandatory racial bias training for all staff and faculty last year, which will be continued on a regular basis and required for new employees; contracting with an African American counselor to provide counseling services for students; launching the Ayana mental health platform to better support marginalized and intersectional students on campus, with SUA paying for these counseling services; the athletics department working with Rise to Win, a nonprofit organization that works with sports communities to eliminate racial discrimination; and new orientation sessions for incoming students on the issue of race and discrimination led by Student Affairs. While we have made progress, we are committed to continue the process of eliminating all forms of discrimination. In line with this goal, I am pleased to announce the creation of the new SUA Center for Race, Ethnicity, and Human Rights. The new center will be a resource for the community to carry out dialogue on these important issues. The center will host outstanding individuals from around the country and the globe, whose work is essential to increasing our understanding and progress on addressing the issues confronting our society, including global and local ethnic conflict as well as systemic and institutional racism in our country. It is my hope that this center will examine and explore how to confront what Mr. Ikeda, in his 1993 Harvard University address, termed “the arrow of a discriminatory consciousness” that has plagued the minds of humankind for thousands of years. The center will be co-directed by Ian Read, current director of the International Studies concentration, and Kevin Moncrief, vice president for Mission Integration. Initial faculty fellows will be Lisa MacLeod, Veronica Quezada, and Nidanie Henderson-Stull. Three student fellows will be appointed, including one Soka Student Union Executive Council representative. Fellows of the center will serve a two-year term. The initial co-directors and fellows, working closely with Michael Weiner, our new vice president for Academic Affairs and interim dean of faculty, will help develop policies and procedures; solicit ideas for and establish initial programming; identify and create an external advisory group; and create a selection process for future fellows. Faculty fellows will also develop new innovative classes under the theme of the center. I will also initiate this fall a search for a presidential hire in a new faculty position in Black Studies. The search will be led by Professor Weiner and a search committee consisting of the co-directors and fellows of the Center for Race, Ethnicity, and Human Rights. The committee will make every effort to include opinions and suggestions from the Soka community, especially from those students in the Black Student Union and Students of Color Coalition who have spearheaded the call for this hire and other curricular changes still being discussed, including a proposal for a new African and Ethnic Studies concentration, which the students presented to the faculty forum last semester. I am also pleased to announce the establishment of the SUA Office for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. As an initial step we have appointed Maya Gunaseharan as the manager of Diversity Initiatives and Community Building. In this role, Maya will coordinate efforts to develop and maintain a diverse and inclusive community for students, staff, and faculty. Maya graduated in 2019 from SUA’s Master’s program in Educational Leadership and Societal Change. She served seven years as a faculty member, facilitator, and trainer for the National Association of Independent Schools Student Diversity Leadership Conference. In that role, she led the Multiracial Affinity Group and supported the Black Affinity Group collaborating to create curriculum and facilitate workshops for students to engage in identity work. She was formerly the director of Student Activities for Dwight-Englewood School in Englewood, New Jersey, where she partnered with the principal and deans to create a more inclusive community for students of all backgrounds. Together with faculty and students, she created diversity assemblies and programming. She advised student affinity group leaders and created a model grounded in positive youth development practices to serve the needs of the students. I’m confident Maya will do a tremendous job in supporting the university’s efforts to promote diversity and inclusion on our campus. To support this endeavor, I have formed a new Unity and Diversity Council that will serve as an advisory group to the new Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. The council will work closely with Maya to seek input from the community on the type of programming that will be developed, to create proposals for an improved process for investigating acts of micro-aggression, and to help set an agenda and vision for the future of the office. The members of the Unity and Diversity Council are as follows: The appointments to the committee are for one year, and the student affinity groups and faculty representatives can change from year to year. I am excited at the launch of these new initiatives, and I am confident they will create an avenue for positive action based on the entire community’s involvement in setting our agenda moving forward. In his 2012 Peace Proposal to the United Nations, Mr. Ikeda referred to the work of Nobel Peace Laureate Dr. Wangari Maathai. Dr. Maathai, he shared, attributed the success of the Green Belt Movement that she developed to it being “structured to avoid the urge to work for rather than with them [the people].” It is in this same spirit that I hope the 20th Anniversary Steering Committee, the Center for Race, Ethnicity, and Human Rights, and the Unity and Diversity Council will work with the entire SUA community on these important undertakings in the upcoming academic year. We are a young institution, but I believe the mission of our university is immensely critical for our society to realize a world of peace, the wish of all good-hearted people. Let us strive to live up to our university’s mission and become a model of a community of global citizens leading contributive lives. I look forward with great anticipation and vigor to taking on this challenge together with all of you.

{"newspaper": "soka-news", "url": "https://www.soka.edu/news-events/news/soka-university-america-welcomes-its-largest-class-ever", "title": "Soka University of America Welcomes Its Largest Class Ever", "text": "A year of quiet on campus ended August 10 as Soka formally welcomed its newest students to Aliso Viejo. As the 140 members of the Class of 2025—Soka’s largest class yet, representing 23 countries—gathered in the Performing Arts Center, the masks they wore as a Covid precaution didn’t make a dent in their excitement. The dim hall lit up as faces of the Soka community popped up on the big screen to extend a warm welcome to the first-year students. Following the hour-long celebration, the students enjoyed dinner outside on the campus green. A highlight of the celebration came as Dean of Students Hyon Moon read a message from SUA founder Daisaku Ikeda. Referring to the university as, “the highest seed of learning for global citizens that cast the light of hope for all,” Mr. Ikeda thanked Soka’s administration, staff, and faculty for their work preparing for the return to campus before reminding students of the importance of their mission in an uncertain world. “Humanity today faces an ordeal of unprecedented magnitude,” wrote Mr. Ikeda. “Now more than ever, a new vision, an alternate philosophy and the fostering of a global citizenry entrusted to realize these ends is needed to establish a global society that lives in peace and co-exist in harmony. Every one of you stands at the forefront of this grand and noble challenge, the brightest and most capable of individuals who have come here on this milestone year, the 20th anniversary of Soka’s founding.” The afternoon’s emcees, orientation leaders Moeka Ho ’23 and Randy Lindenmayer ’23, kicked off the program, followed by remarks from Soka Student Union Executive Council President Yuka Hombo ’22. Hombo reflected on her deepening understanding of Soka’s mission while studying from her home in Japan during the pandemic. “One of the main lessons I learned in the past three years was that being able to speak some languages or having abundant knowledge doesn’t necessarily make us a global citizen who can contribute to the welfare of others,” Hombo said. “Our founder listed wisdom, courage, and compassion as the three attributes of global citizenship. I strongly believe the mission statement is about us developing these qualities during our time at SUA and beyond by constantly asking ourselves how can we develop as an individual, how can we live the contributive life, and how can we truly embody SUA’s mission?” Representing the sometimes challenging paths students from around the world have followed to arrive at Soka, three students shared their own journeys. Julia Mayumi Miyagawa Braga ’25 described how after transferring from a Soka school to a prestigious high school in San Paolo, Brazil, her life didn’t resemble the movie, “High School Musical,” as she’d hoped. The school’s competitive environment and the anxiety and depression among her peers was dispiriting. Braga returned to her former school, where the positive reaction of friends and teachers taught her about courage and following her own path. Paridhi Khanduri ’25 also described having different values than some of her peers while in high school in India. She’d learned from her family that education was “a lifelong endeavor to gain knowledge and learn how to use that knowledge to create value in real life,” not, as she witnessed around her, to value education only as a means to secure a job. Her commitment to those values prompted her to follow in the footsteps of her sister, Subhagya, a member of the Class of 2017. “In today’s world facing rapid climate, digital, economic, political, and health changes, I believe that it becomes prudent to raise individuals equipped with creating value from the uncertain and individuals who know the values that drive their actions,” Khanduri said. “Soka values that the purpose of education is to develop a vast knowledge base, providing an opportunity for in-depth study in areas of interest, thus raising the intellectual quotient of students and making us capable leaders sensitive towards societal issues in a balanced environment.” While growing up in Hawaii, Kenichi Price ’25 learned difficult but valuable lessons from his younger sister, Naomi, who suffered permanent brain damage after contracting bacterial meningitis as a baby and was unable to move or speak. After Naomi’s death in 2019, he chose to transform his grief into determination to help others. While Price originally wanted to pursue engineering, Soka’s overall mission was a stronger pull. “Reflecting on Naomi’s life I was reminded of the courageous spirit she would constantly exemplify and how despite her circumstances she never failed to motivate and encourage me and countless others,” he said. “Gradually these reflections allowed me to transform the negative feelings I was struggling with into a newfound determination to dedicate my life to the wellbeing of others.” After reminding the Class of 2025 to remain vigilant against Covid-19 and follow the precautions of wearing masks, testing, and contact tracing, President Ed Feasel recalled how a quote he saw from Mr. Ikeda about following a dream remained in the back of his mind as he decided to study economics and become a professor. In 2000, he had a pivotal conversation with Mr. Ikeda in which he told him about the inspiring quote. “He said, ‘Yes, the dream is very important in life, the dream becomes our direction in life, it becomes our source of energy,’” Pres. Feasel said. Pres. Feasel encouraged the first-year students to take their dreams seriously. “What I want is to encourage you to start developing your vision for your future,” he said, “to really start thinking about what field you want to specialize in, what career you want to pursue, what will be your life’s work, your life’s mission, because that vision will set the course for your life.” He also urged the students to fully embrace Soka’s principles of courage, compassion, and wisdom as they learn to become global citizens. “It’s how, you know, we serve our community,” he said. “To have courage not to deny our differences, but to learn from them. To have compassion that if any one of us is suffering, to feel like it’s our own suffering, and the wisdom to realize that we’re all interconnected, and our actions can affect each other in a positive way to help us overcome our suffering, to help us grow. And so this culture, this ethic of global citizenship, is the perfect environment to develop your contributive spirit.” Pres. Feasel closed his remarks describing the friendship between Mr. Ikeda and Linus Pauling, the Nobel Prize winning scientist for whom Linus and Ava Helen Pauling Hall was dedicated. When Pres. Feasel was a graduate student at UC Berkeley, he had the opportunity to meet Dr. Pauling when he was asked to pick him up at the airport after a dialogue that Dr. Pauling had with Mr. Ikeda at SUA’s Calabasas campus. On that drive, Dr. Pauling mentioned revisiting a challenging problem he’d put aside 10 years before and regretting he hadn’t solved it sooner. “And I realized, in those words, the essence of the greatness of Dr. Pauling. And that work ethic to always push himself,” Pres. Feasel said. “When I think about my own experience, it was really during college that I learned that work ethic. So I really want to encourage you also, during your time here at Soka to not have any regrets, to make every effort possible to realize the goals that you set.”", "categories": ["Campus News"], "date_publish": "September 04, 2021", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

After more than a year of our efforts and desire to bring students back to campus, we have finally achieved our goal. I want to thank all our staff and faculty for your meticulous planning and efforts to realize this accomplishment, and all our students for your patience and support of the necessary policies and procedures for us to have in-person education again at SUA. Of course, we are still in an uncertain time with the Delta variant and the potential of other new variants emerging, and so I ask that we all remain vigilant in following the policies and protocols we have in place to prevent breakthrough cases on campus. With the successful completion of our Core 1 block last week as an example of what is possible, I am confident as a community we will rise to the challenge of successfully conducting in-person education for the Fall semester. Toward this end, following our masking policy and getting tested as soon as possible at the health center if you have symptoms, will be important in our success. I believe another advantage we have in our efforts is the goal based on our university mission for each of us to become a global citizen committed to living a contributive life. Based on our consistent efforts to bring forth courage, compassion, and wisdom from within our lives, the care and support we provide each other based on this ethic of global citizenship will be key to our success. To build and solidify this culture of global citizenship on campus, let us all continue to advance and grow individually, while strengthening our commitment and action to work for the benefit of others in our community as well. I thank you for your efforts to contribute to building this culture of global citizenship at SUA. As we begin a new semester, I would also like to share a recent interaction I had with a donor, as I believe in addition to our founder Daisaku Ikeda, our donors have the greatest expectations and hopes for all of us at SUA, especially for our students. One donor I met together with her daughter and son, shared the story of her eldest daughter who graduated from Soka Women’s College in Japan, who set her sights on being a member of the first class of SUA. As she prepared to apply for SUA while working, she found out she had cancer. She was determined to go to SUA even if she was delayed and might have to enter the second or third year. While she survived to witness the opening of the new century, she passed away in January 2001. A month later her family made a donation to SUA and had her name placed on our Founders Circle Donor Wall. When I asked how the family heard about that opportunity and decided to make the donation, the brother replied, “it was her wish, her life savings, and her instructions that we do so.” She wanted all the money and whatever insurance money to go to support SUA students. Her family has continued to support SUA as donors over the years. Each one of the donor names we see on campus have an incredible story behind them. What they have in common, I have found, is their appreciation to Mr. Ikeda for all his efforts to support them and to promote peace throughout the world, and their hopes and belief in the students of SUA to become leaders in society who will usher in a new era of peace for humanity. I feel very fortunate to work together with all of you here at SUA with the incredible mission we have to send global citizens into the world to change the course of humanity. Please take care and I look forward to seeing all of you around campus.

Spurring economic development in communities by recycling environmental waste. Empowering students with knowledge to spark civic engagement. Soka students and alumni presented these and other social enterprises as part of the 24-hour Impactathon. The round-the-clock event on Nov. 1-2 brought students and alumni together to design and pitch creative business solutions to global issues. Led by author, entrepreneur, and Impactathon founder Neetal Parekh, the social enterprise boot camp introduced participants to legal structures, business models, impact measurement frameworks, and funding options. Soka students came away with a deeper understanding of how social enterprises can change the world and three winning student enterprises earned seed money for development. A panel of business professionals, including Brian Walker, the manager of the diversity and inclusion program at the Walt Disney Company, set the tone with stories of the viability of social enterprises: with a unique mission and clever use of resources, a business can be both charitable and profitable. Eight Soka teams pitched enterprises to a panel of judges, including social impact attorney Shaheen Sheik-Sadhal, Lake Forest Economic Development Manager Carlo Tomaino, and urban planner Stephanie Roxas. Each team had a few minutes to explain their mission and present an informed strategy. The judges then evaluated the ideas for creativity, feasibility, and potential impact. The winning enterprises: “It’s exciting to witness students take their ideas for positive social impact into the business world,” said Mary Patrick Kavanaugh, Soka director of special projects and founder of the B2B program. “Impactathon is one of many pathways we offer for students at Soka to experience entrepreneurship, and it’s important for students to have a realistic experience of the sector. Turning ideas into action isn’t easy, but the students gain excellent transferable skills that make them more employable.” Since Impactathon in November, B2B students have attended workshops at UC Irvine and met with business mentors from different sectors to refine their ideas. Soka’s B2B program has multiple pathways for students to build skills and experience entrepreneurship.

The workshop was held at the Beall Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship as part of the UCI New Venture Competition, an opportunity for UCI students and now Soka B2B students to pitch ideas and develop concept papers to compete for $100,000 in prizes. According to Mary Patrick Kavanaugh, the director of special projects and founder of the B2B program, “The New Venture Competition is one of many Beall Center initiatives designed to incubate business growth in Orange County. The partnership between B2B and UCI now allows our entrepreneurial-minded students to be key contributors to OC’s robust and entrepreneurial ecosystem.” Sara Heimann, UCI’s Innovation & Entrepreneurship Librarian, introduced the students to databases like IBISWorld, PitchBook, and Mintel which provide market research and consumer reports. Team B2B students have attended five workshops and will attend five more on subjects like “Demystifying Intellectual Property” and “How to Build a Winning Pitch Deck.” When asked how the New Venture Competition workshops have helped, B2B’s Maxine Xu ‘22 replied: “This is a unique opportunity to put theory into practice; we get to come up with an idea and learn how to best execute it.” Another student, Moses Addai ‘22 from the 2nd place enterprise Arsenova at November’s Impactathon, said: “Teamwork, networking, and competition. We get better at them every time.” After the workshop concluded, the B2B students had a chance to network with UCI students and business mentors. Throughout the course of the New Venture Competition, UCI and Soka students can gain valuable insight from specialists in finance, marketing, and other business fields. Sergio Morales ‘22, B2B student and member of Ensendio, the 1st place enterprise at B2B’s November Impactathon, appreciated the opportunities afforded by Soka’s relationship with UCI: “Our collaboration with UCI provides us so much. More people are listening to our ideas.” Eddie Ng ‘13, the B2B program’s alumni ambassador, marveled at the state of the B2B program: “We didn’t have any of this when I was a student. It’s amazing to see where B2B has gone.” As the B2B program grows, Soka students can expect even greater resources for their entrepreneurial ventures. Until then, collaborations with UCI and other institutions provide the B2B students with unique opportunities to network and develop their ideas. —Riley Murphy ‘20", "categories": ["Bridges to Business"], "date_publish": "February 27, 2020", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Feasel", "text": "Dear Soka Community, I am very honored to become president of SUA and I want to thank the Board of Trustees for showing their trust in me through their selection . I am especially grateful to our university founder, Daisaku Ikeda, for establishing SUA as a citadel of education for global citizenship. It was my distinct pleasure to serve in Danny Habuki’s administration for over 20 years and I thank and congratulate him on all of his accomplishments during his incredible tenure as SUA president. Becoming president of SUA at this auspicious time as we celebrate the upcoming 20th anniversary of the undergraduate program, I am focused on recommitting to the founding principles and spirit upon which Mr. Ikeda established SUA. In his speech at Teacher’s College, Columbia University, Mr. Ikeda clearly outlined the three attributes of a global citizen as courage, compassion and wisdom; attributes that encourage an inner transformation of the individual to see oneself as part of a larger community where we all serve each other to enhance our individual and collective existence. The foundation of SUA is based upon the values of peace, human rights, and the sanctity of life. I look forward to embarking on a deeper community discussion and effort to realize these principles and spirit on our campus. It is also imperative that we continue and build upon the efforts that we initiated earlier this year to respond to the challenge posed by all forms of racial bias and discrimination that we have experienced on campus and see in society. In both these regards, I will be releasing another statement in the near future on some new initiatives I will be implementing as president. On the occasion of this new departure, I have also discussed the new leadership of the university with the Board of Trustees and, as a first step in this effort to recommit to the founding principles, I would like to announce the appointment of Kevin Moncrief as vice president for mission integration. Dr. Moncrief has an extensive career in higher education and business, as well as a long history of work and understanding of Mr. Ikeda’s philosophy of global citizenship. Bryan Penprase will serve as our new vice president for sponsored research and external academic relations. Michael Weiner will become our vice president for academic affairs and interim dean of faculty. Vice President Weiner and Penprase’s appointments will be effective August 16. Along with these new appointments, I am creating an SUA Leadership Council including other deans, vice presidents and myself. The full membership of the SUA Leadership Council is as follows: I believe that leadership is always a position of service. Together with all members of the SUA Leadership Council, we look forward to working together with and serving all of you, the members of the Soka community.

Half of the funds will come from a second round of supplemental aid from the US government, the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act. The act, signed into law in December 2020, authorized more than $20 billion in emergency relief funding for higher education, intended to be distributed directly to students and offset institutional costs caused by the pandemic. SUA will receive $175,563 in Higher Education Emergency Relief II funding for emergency aid to eligible students. The US Department of Education has not issued guidance on whether international, DACA, or undocumented students may receive these funds, therefore Soka will only be awarding HEERF II funds to Title IV eligible domestic students. For those enrolled students who are not eligible for these federal funds, including international students, Soka has decided to provide $170,720 of its own institutional funds in Soka Cares II grants to provide emergency aid. The Office of Financial Aid has begun the process of awarding funds, which will be distributed in early April. “We are very excited to release this second round of funding to our students who have endured so much throughout the pandemic,” said Andrew Woolsey, dean of enrollment services. “We are also especially grateful to all of our donors, who through their generosity have given us the ability to support our students and help fulfill our university mission.” For more detailed information on the HEERF II and Soka Cares II grant programs, please visit the Financial Aid COVID-19 FAQ page .", "categories": ["COVID-19 Update", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "April 07, 2021", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

{"newspaper": "soka-news", "url": "https://www.soka.edu/news-events/news/presidents-message-regarding-spring-2021-semester", "title": "President's Message Regarding the Spring 2021 Semester", "text": "Dear SUA Community, This has been an extremely difficult year especially since we moved to deliver education remotely in March. I know that some of us have lost loved ones and friends or are experiencing great challenges due to the coronavirus. With the current surge of COVID-19 cases in the United States, many institutions have been left to make difficult decisions regarding opening their campuses for spring. For the current semester, we decided to close the campus and provide our education completely remotely for the safety of all campus community members. However, throughout the semester, many students shared some very challenging circumstances they were facing having to navigate their education remotely. Therefore, we decided if we could do it safely, to open the campus for the spring semester for those students who may not have other options for a suitable learning environment. Although COVID-19 cases are currently at their highest, we also have had time since the beginning of this pandemic to learn from other universities experiences, prepare, and implement safety measures to open the campus. Based on this preparation, we are confident that we can safely reopen the university for the spring semester welcoming back some of our students to campus, while making every effort to ensure a safe and supportive environment for all members of the SUA community. We will also continue to provide the best support available to those of you who will be working or learning from home. We are now in earnest preparation to welcome a portion of our student body back to campus for Spring 2021 if conditions allow. In November, students received information via e-mail, video presentations and Zoom Q&A sessions with various offices such as Financial Aid, Office of the Dean of Faculty, Residential Life, Student Services, Office of the Registrar, and International Student Services regarding what it means for students to continue their remote learning versus residing on campus. We wanted to ensure that students had as much information as possible that would aid them in making a decision that would be best for their circumstances for Spring, including understanding the strict conditions of life on campus that each student must agree and adhere to. Students were then given the opportunity to apply to reside on campus, and we anticipate that 174 students will return to campus in the spring. The COVID-19 campus committees, which include Return to Campus Planning Committee, In-person Education Committee, and Liberal Arts in a Pandemic Committee, and individual areas have been working tirelessly to ensure that protocols and safety measures are being put in place to open the campus safely. As you may be aware, we have contracted with the American College Health Association (ACHA) through which we consulted with a Clinical Professor of Medicine and former chair of the ACHA Task Force on COVID-19 as well as a student health center director who prepared a report advising how we can open the campus in the safest manner possible. We are also learning from other universities that have been able to open safely and limit the number of cases on their campus. We have hired a COVID project manager and created a COVID Prevention Plan . It is evident that one of the most important steps that we need to take is rigorous COVID-19 surveillance testing. Therefore, we will be implementing a coronavirus antigen testing protocol of twice a week for students and once a week for faculty, staff, and contractor employees coming to campus. All students will be tested as soon as they arrive on campus before moving into their residential hall and will spend up to 14 days quarantined. Students will need to clear two negative COVID-19 test results without any symptoms before they will be released from quarantine. Various procedures for surveillance testing, contact tracing, and additional safety measures are being put together to ensure we have a safe and smooth return to campus. We also meet regularly with representatives from the Orange County Health Agency to ensure that the university is up-to-date on any changes to county regulations that may impact the re-opening of the campus for the spring semester. All individuals on campus will be required to wear masks and maintain physical distancing. Students and employees will be held to high standards of conduct. I encourage all community members to visit our Coronavirus webpage periodically to be familiar with current policies and other steps to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and for students returning to campus to refer to the Brightspace course. Faculty and staff will continue to telework at this time. Only those employees who have essential functions should be coming to campus while following the safety protocols such as daily symptom checking, mandatory facial coverings, and social distancing. Only essential visitors continue to be allowed on campus. With a community-wide commitment to keeping each other healthy and safe, I am confident we can open for our students in Spring 2021 as planned. I know this past year has been one of the most challenging for all of us. I would like to thank: In closing, I want to ask our students to please take care as you complete your final exams and final papers. I wish all of you and your loved ones a safe and happy holidays.

Here is a sampling of recent faculty publications and notable research projects: Professor Weiner’s new book the Routledge Handbook of Race and Ethnicity in Asia introduces theoretical approaches to the study of race, ethnicity, and indigeneity in Asia beyond those commonly grounded in the Western experience. The volume’s 28 chapters consider not only the relationship between ethnic or racial minorities and the state, but social relations within and between individual and transnational communities. These shape not only the contours of governance, but also the means by which knowledge of national identity, “self,” and “other” have been constructed and reconstructed over time. Divided into four sections, it provides holistic and comparative coverage of South, South East, and East Asia, as well as Australasia and Oceania—an area that extends from Pakistan in the west to Hawai’i in the east. Contributors to this handbook offer a variety of disciplinary and interdisciplinary perspectives, opening a domain of scholarship wherein the relationship between phenotype and racism is less pronounced than European and North American approaches that, which have often privileged the so-called “colour stigmata,” leading to further exclusions of particular ethnic, racial, and Indigenous communities. By focusing on race and ethnicity in Asia, this volume provides a valuable resource to both students and scholars of comparative racial and ethnic studies, international relations, and human rights. International Studies Professor Barter published an article, “Indonesian Autonomies: Explaining Divergent Self-Government Outcomes in Aceh and Papua,” in Publius: The Journal of Federalism . Co-authored with Hipolitus Wangge, an Indonesian PhD student at Australian National University, the article analyzes why self-government helped overcome secessionist war in Aceh but failed to stop violence in Papua. The authors suggest that self-government is not only about which powers are granted, but how they are negotiated and who wields them. Professor Barter also published a new chapter, “Ethnic Conflicts in Southeast Asia,” in Routledge Handbook on Race and Ethnicity in Asia , edited by Prof. Weiner. Professor Pearce’s work was featured in a solo exhibition that opened June 12, 2021, at AMcE Creative Arts, a new fine art gallery and cultural space in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle. The show, Sommerset , includes her mixed media collage series Path and a site-specific installation, Icarus , which forms a wall-sized wave of hundreds of individual paintings on paper. Prof. Peace will also display ceramic pieces inspired by Icarus with works created in collaboration with ceramicist Don Ryan. Upcoming exhibitions include a solo installation of Icarus at the Crossroads Hotel Gallery and Studio curated by Hesse McGraw Executive Director of CAM Houston and a two-person exhibition of glass sculptures at Providence College Galleries curated by Kate McNamara. Professor Takaku was interviewed by a reporter from the Japan Times regarding professional tennis player Naomi Osaka’s decision to withdraw from the French Open and Wimbledon due to a mental health crisis. The article came out just before the Tokyo Olympics, where Osaka represented her home country Japan. The article raised a timely issue, as another female athlete, US gymnast Simone Biles withdrew from some Olympic events citing mental health concerns. The article can be found on the Japan Times website . Professor Allinson was guest editor of “Do We Need a New Enlightenment for the Twenty-first Century?”, a special issue of Dialogue & Universalism . In our current time of denial of reason and sciences in which Covid-19 vaccines are abjured by some in favor of remedies, unproved by scientific inquiry and scientific method, Enlightenment values of science and reason seriously need to be reconsidered. Proclaiming these values and, yet, ignoring their application to ethnic and racial minorities and, indeed, subjecting racial and ethnic minorities to discrimination and slavery, highlights the need for critical review. This issue represents contributions from philosophers at universities from Africa, Asia, North America, the Middle East, Western, and Eastern Europe to take part in a world dialogue reexamining this significant period from our past to gain insight into new directions for our future. Professor Caldwell spent the summer working with medical and healthcare practitioners to identify and address Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) issues beyond race and ethnicity to include gender, sexuality, class, and the varied lived experience and context of folx and their histories. Prof. Caldwell used a critical intersectional health equity lens for this project (and of course intersectional feminist and queer theory), with a focus on increasing healthcare access and equity, while expanding their own ways of knowing —so much so that future research and teaching pedagogy will reflect these experiences. This is a continuation of their research into DEI that began in 2014 of social justice activism, which has segued into discussions of public sociology and justice within corporate and healthcare institutions. Prof. Caldwell was able to engage past Soka students in these discussions as well as current colleagues. Additionally, Prof. Caldwell organized a digital LGBTQ Pride celebration for Scarleteen , worked on a documentary interview project of LGBTQ+ performance artists in Mexico, and began an extensive project of organizing and digitizing archives for the Los Angeles Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, a LGBTQ+ nonprofit in Los Angeles. Professor Walsh spent nine weeks during the summer working in the new Curie Hall with Erica Koyama ‘23 and Micaela Lafrenz ’23 to tackle a project that Koyama had proposed during her bioinformatics independent study last fall. Finally in-person and in the lab this summer, they cloned and expressed uncharacterized yeast nitrilase proteins in bacteria and initiated studies to identify the activity of these proteins. Koyama presented their work as a virtual poster at the SoCal Undergraduate Chemistry Research Symposium in August. The poster is now displayed on the third floor of Curie Hall. Professor Takahashi has published the paper, “Wronged Translators in U.S.-Japan Politics” in the recent issue of Asia Pacific Translation and Intercultural Studies . Prof. Takahashi was inspired to write this paper when she taught an independent study course several years ago for International Studies concentration students interested in translation studies. Based on the reading assignments and lectures she had given to the students, she drafted a paper, presented it at an international conference, and expanded and updated it before submitting it to the journal. Professor Wilson, a member of the editorial collective of Latin American Perspectives , organized an international online conference with the authors who contributed to her co-edited special issue of LAP, “Gender, Sexuality, Film, and Media in Latin America: Challenging Representation and Structures” (March 2021). The issue is co-edited with Prof. Clara Garavelli from the University of Leicester. The conference can be accessed on the LAP Films website or on YouTube . Professor Quezada presented “ Desierto sonoro: ecos y cuerpos ocultos en la historia estadounidense” (“Hidden Echoes and Bodies in American History in the novel Lost Children Archive ”) at the 2021 Latin American Studies Association Conference: Global Crisis, Inequalities, and the Centrality of Life last May. Prof. Quezada’s talk analyzed the intertwining of American immigration history and Central American migrations in the novel Lost Children Archive (2019). In June, Prof. Quezada participated in the first conference on Afro-Latin American studies (1er Encuentro Internacional de Investigadores Estudios Afrolatinoamericanos). Her talk, “Proyecciones de la herencia afromexicana en la narrativa nacional: María Luisa Puga y nuestras raíces africanas,” analyzed one of the first inclusions of an African heritage in Mexican literature. In addition, she participated in the Seventh Annual International Conference Latin America: Tradition and Globalizations in the 21st Century, in July. Her talk, “Cuerpos migrantes: centroamericanos surcando el territorio mexicano,” analyzed the representation of Central American migration in Mexican literature. Professor Kirsch received a book contract from Southern Illinois University Press for a co-edited volume, Unsettling Archival Research: Engaging Critical, Communal, and Digital Archives . This book is one of the first publications in rhetoric and writing studies to unsettle disciplinary knowledge of archival research by drawing on decolonial, Indigenous, antiracist, queer, local, and community perspectives. The volume includes both critiques of archiving as a set of institutional practices, ideologies, and conventions, and new tactics of engaging critical, communal, and digital archiving within and against systems of power. Contributors reflect on how to counteract, resist, and explore alternatives to racist, colonial histories; highlight how radical political approaches might support such work; and illuminate how tactical archival practices can decenter and reshape traditional archival methodologies. The book originated during Prof. Kirsch’s visiting professorship at the University of Louisville in fall 2019 and continues her mentorship of doctoral students and emerging scholars. Several years ago, Professor Mazumder started putting a data set together based on a hunch. This summer she presented the results on the Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency Standard (CAFÉ) at the conference of the Western Economic Association International (WEAI). A usual effect documented with the CAFÉ standard is that it encourages driving, thereby not being as effective at reducing gasoline consumption from the personal transport sector as the preferred alternative of a gasoline tax. However, CAFÉ standards also result in changes in vehicle attributes that American customers care about such as weight, power, acceleration, and size of the vehicle. Prof. Mazumder’s paper estimates the extent to which these changes in vehicle attributes affect driving. Results show that under the CAFÉ standard, the increase in driving is dampened by the attribute changes, potentially making the CAFE standard less of a poor policy choice relative to the gasoline tax. Professor Spady traveled to South Carolina to research his book on the racial and ethnic politics of an antislavery movement in Charleston. In 1822, a group of free and enslaved black men planned to fight their way to ships in Charleston harbor and flee the country. Their movement attracted American-born people as well as Igbos and men of various other African ethnicities. Betrayed to authorities before they could attempt their rebellion, the movement nonetheless helped rebirth antislavery agitation in the country. But the movement’s diversity has never been analyzed and the archive’s reliability has been questioned. Prof. Spady’s research this summer developed documentary evidence for two lines of argument intended to advance debate about the archive’s veracity and provenance. He has been collecting handwriting samples to identify the clerk who made the records. He has also been mapping the social relationships and urban geography of the organizers. Professor Golden produced and edited a video report on the work of Music in Common, which aired online July 30. Music in Common is a US-based organization focused on promoting peacebuilding through engaging diverse populations in collaborative music-making activities. Trey Carlisle ’19 and Kiyomi Muro ‘19 have leadership roles in the group, and current students Art Beck ’22 and Anjan Rana Magar ’23 are also actively involved. The 12-minute video is part of a series put on by the Min-On Concert Association entitled “Share Music Day,” and features Carlisle and others. You can watch it here, with this note: the first 1:20 is an introduction in Japanese; the Music in Common portion , with Japanese subtitles, starts at 2’30.” Prof. Golden anticipates offering the course “Music and Peacebuilding” in the 2022-23 academic year. Professor Galles, and poet Jerome Rothenberg’s translation of the Polish poet Cyprian Norwid’s poem, “Chopin’s Piano,” has been published in a new book, In Memory Of The Polish Poet Cyprian Norwid 1821-1883 by Józef Franciszek Fert. This month Cambridge Scholars Publishing is highlighting a new book that discusses COVID-19 and other epidemic diseases. The book, co-edited by Professors Read and Andrea Patterson (Cal State Fullerton), is The Shape of Epidemics and Global Disease (2020). It investigates global disease’s multifaceted SHAPES (socio-historic, artistic, political, and ecological significance). The book includes essays by SUA Professors Xiaoxing Liu, Lisa Crummet, Ted Lowe, and Michael Weiner. SHAPES emerged from two interdisciplinary conferences, the first held in February 2017 on CSUF’s campus. SUA hosted the second conference, titled “Disease and Disease Control in the Eras of Globalization,” in September 2017 in the Athenaeum. The publisher’s website also features three short videos with contributors , including Professors Lisa Crummett and Ian Read. Professor Peters guest-edited a thematic issue on “Natural Playscapes and Outdoor Education” for the journal Built Environment . Her editorial can be freely accessed on the journal’s website and a shorter blog introducing the different articles is available on Alexandrine Press’ “Blogged Environment” page . This issue was partially inspired by her Winter 2020 “Moved by Nature” Learning Cluster Trip to Scandinavia, focuses on how nature has been incorporated into playscapes; and how virtual or “smart” elements of play are complementing or otherwise influencing the way children and young adults are experiencing the outdoors. The contributions include examples of outdoor play in Europe, the United States and Mexico and, importantly, they give voice to practitioners as well as academics. Prof. Peters recently received a PBRC Faculty Fellowship to further expand on this work and organize a small academic symposium on the topic at SUA next spring.

Here is a sampling of recent faculty publications and notable research projects: Professor Spady and four co-authors published an essay entitled “Chicanx Histories of the Present: A Praxis Against Gang Injunctions in Orange County, California, 2008-2016.” The essay is free to read on the University College London’s open access academic journal Radical Americas. The work examines community organizing by Chicanxs Unidxs (CU), which has addressed gang injunctions, a law enforcement practice that disproportionately curtails the freedoms of thousands of Black and Latinx Californians. The organization has led efforts to replace gang injunctions with social science solutions that respect youth rights. Among CU’s accomplishments, reported in the article, was a landmark due process ruling in California Superior Court in 2013. Over the years, several Soka students have contributed to CU’s activism and research, including Alex Scott ‘15, a co-author of the essay who is currently completing a PhD in sociology at UC Riverside. Professor Hwang has received a fellowship from the Academy of Korean Studies (AKS) in Seongnam, South Korea, for 2022. As an AKS fellow, he will visit the AKS campus next spring to conduct a research project, “In Search of ‘Silent Revolution’: Anarchist Education in Post-1945 Korea. Prof. Hwang will present results of the research in a seminar at AKS. Prof. Hwang also has two new publications in a special December 2021 issue of Inter-Asia Cultural Studies, “After Dirlik: History, World, and Radical Imaginations.” He contributed an essay, “Arif Dirlik in South Korea,” and an interview, “The Cultural Revolution and Its Significance in World History: An Interview with Arif Dirlik.” Professor Ogata was a panelist at the Gender and Genocide in the 21st Century Conference held by Newlines Institute September. The virtual conference examined state responses to gendered crimes during conflict or genocide, and how the crime of genocide entails gendered violence. Prof. Ogata appeared on a panel discussing “Challenges to Justice for Sexual Violence in Conflict & Genocide,” and using Japan-Korea relations concerning the comfort women issue as a case reference, discussed intersections of revisionism, denialism, and negationism in redressing transnational historical accountability. Prof. Ogata also moderated a panel on “the effects of media framing on public engagement with atrocity prevention and response,” one of 16 workshops that took place virtually during the 4th International Meeting of Global Action Against Mass Atrocities Crimes (GAAMAC) on November 15-18. GAAMAC is an inclusive and collaborative network of states, civil society organizations, and academic institutions with the support of the United Nations to provide a platform for the prevention of atrocities (genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing). GAAMAC is currently led by the governments of Argentina, Costa Rica, Denmark, Switzerland, and Tanzania, and Prof. Ogata serves as a member of the GAAMAC Steering Group. Professor Allinson has published a chapter, “Marie Pauline Eboh’s Dedication to Humanity and Philosophy: Gynism, Hegel’s Master Slave Dialectic, Marxism and the Influence of Simone de Beauvoir,” in Philosophy, Universal Dialogue and Intersectionality, Philosophical Essays in Honour of Marie Pauline Eboh, edited by Maraizu Elechi and Christiana C. M. N. Idika. Prof. Allinson extensively investigates and explains insights about the corpus of philosopher Marie Pauline Eboh. Marie Eboh, a Nigerian philosopher known for her original concepts of gender theory and how they are different from Western feminism. A professor at Rivers State University of Science and Technology in Nigeria, she has been hailed by scholars as one of the finest minds in Africa. In the book’s foreword, Professor Nlerum Sunday Okogbule, vice chancellor of Rivers State, highlights Prof. Allinson’s work, stating that it is “through the examination of the development and the interconnectedness of Eboh’s concepts that we can see how genuine freedom and therefore humanism can be achieved.” Prof. Allinson also participated in an international conference, “What’s New and What’s Next in Jewish Studies,” hosted by the Polin Museum in Warsaw, on the alarming rise of anti-Jewish hate acts, especially throughout the US and Europe. Professor Barter presented a new paper, “Understanding Self-Government: Towards a Typology of Territorial Autonomy,” as part of a panel at the International Studies West meeting. The meeting was held in Pasadena and virtually in September. Prof. Barter also has published a chapter in a new book, Paramilitary Groups and the State under Globalization. His chapter, “Disturbing the Peace: Paramilitarism across Southeast Asia,” analyzes the regions many types of militias in this diverse world region, noting how many do not fit into dominant views of paramilitary groups. Prof. Barter also presented a paper on “Indigenous Development in Southeast Asia” at the Policy Sciences Institute, Claremont McKenna College (November 19-20). Professor Liu’s collaborative work titled “Local Corruption, Total Factor Productivity and Firm Heterogeneity: Empirical Evidence from Chinese Manufacturing Firms” (joint with Firat Demir, Chenghao Hu and Hewei Shen) was accepted to be published in a top peer-reviewed journal, World Development (impact factor 5.278, 2021) in November. The article can be viewed on the ScienceDirect site . Professor Shinozuka’s book, Biotic Borders: Transpacific Plant and Insect Migration and the Rise of Anti-Asian Racism in America, 1890-1950 (University of Chicago Press), will be published in March 2022. Biotic Borders uncovers the emergence of biological nativism that fueled US imperialism and spurred anti-Asian racism that remains with us today. A book talk will be held at SUA in the late spring of 2022. Professor Wilson has a new essay published in Writing Across the Curriculum Clearinghouse’s journal, Across the Disciplines.

This year’s recipient was Shunji Fueki, the 2020-21 Soka Student Union executive committee president. In addition to the challenge of leading in a remote environment, Fueki is spearheading a 20th anniversary project to publish university founder Daisaku Ikeda’s speeches. Fueki was awarded a prestigious scholarship for graduate studies sponsored by the Japanese government. Starting this fall, he will study at Georgetown University Law School and prepare for his future career as a lawyer specializing in international law. “Thank you very much for this significant award, which I received on behalf of my amazing classmates,” Fueki said. “I would like to express my sincere appreciation to the university founder Mr. Ikeda for founding SUA. As an SUA alumnus, I will do my best to live up to SUA’s mission statement. I look forward to celebrating SUA’s 30th, 40th, and 50th anniversaries and hope to give back my skills and experiences to the SUA community then!” This year SUA established the Lei Loi Tak Memorial Scholarship, funded by the Virtue Education Trust, Hong Kong, in honor of the late Lei Loi Tak, an entrepreneur and philanthropist from Macau. He was a generous donor to SUA beginning in its foundational years and his daughter, Doris, is an alumna from the Class of 2006. The scholarship is awarded to students who pursue an accelerated MA or MBA program at Claremont Graduate University—and starting next academic year the University San Diego’s Joan B.

I know that we continue to live in unprecedented times with the pandemic and most recently the unrest and tragic events in our nation’s capital. Considering this I wish I could share better news, but the winter COVID peak in Southern California has been more severe than officials expected. Given the current and near term forecast for the COVID pandemic in Orange County, we have come to the difficult decision to delay bringing our students back to campus at the beginning of the Spring semester. The class schedule for the semester will remain as planned and all classes will begin remotely. Based on data showing extensive holiday travel and gatherings, both NIAID Director Anthony Fauci and CIDRAP Director Michael Osterholm have suggested in interviews that we can expect the number of daily COVID cases to continue to rise until around the middle of January. Hospitalizations and deaths will continue to rise until mid-February, putting increasing strain on an already overstrained hospital system. Current ICU bed capacity is at 0 percent in Southern California. We cannot bring our students into a community where hospital resources would be in question if one of our students was in need of them. Our consultants from the American College Health Association concur with this decision. In addition, the new B.1.1.7 coronavirus strain, first reported in the UK, has now been reported in Southern California. The science on this new strain is by no means conclusive, but there are indications that it could be significantly more contagious. If these preliminary estimates turn out to be true, we can expect a particularly severe COVID wave that could continue into the spring. The progress of vaccinations against COVID has also been much slower than predicted (only 4 million vaccinated by the close of 2020 compared to the 20 million predicted), and in any case vaccination is unlikely to cover enough of the population to slow down this winter/spring COVID wave. For all these reasons we have decided to keep the campus closed and not bring students back at this time. If you were accepted to return to campus, you will need to work with our financial aid office to adjust your financial aid offer. You will receive a separate email from the Office of Financial Aid shortly. I understand this decision may create some challenging circumstances for those who were accepted to return to campus, such as housing accommodations. Our Dean of Students, Hyon Moon will also be sending an email shortly to gather information on those situations to determine if and how we might be able to assist. While we have made every effort possible to have some of you return to campus, I know this is disappointing news. Ultimately, I believe it would be irresponsible to bring students back to SUA under the current circumstances in our community. We will continue to monitor the situation with the possibility of permitting students returning later in the spring if circumstances improve. We will provide an update by the end of the month for those students who petitioned and were accepted to return to campus. Please continue to stay healthy and safe.

This January, in cooperation with the County of Orange and the City of Aliso Viejo, Soka University established the second regional Super POD (Point of Dispensing) COVID-19 vaccination site. (The first POD opened the week before at Disneyland.) Vaccinations were first given to health care workers and seniors from south Orange County; eligibility was then expanded to people as young as 12. The county closed its Super PODs on June 5 to focus on mobile delivery of vaccines. By that time 296,594 people were vaccinated at SUA. Soka was prepared to respond quickly to the request of the Orange County Health Department because staff has trained in POD protocols since 2007. How well did it work? Here is an excerpt from an email a grateful participant sent to SUA: “Just had to tell you how impressed I was that Soka University hosted administering the vaccine at your campus. Even more impressed at how well it was organized and executed.

During their spring break they flew to New Orleans to join the disaster relief efforts. Their trip sparked a new SUA tradition: an Alternative Spring Break during which students spend their recess doing community service. Over the years, Alternative Spring Break has developed into a co-curricular service-learning program that combines dialogue-based learning with volunteer service. Participants explore social justice concepts such as privilege, oppression, intersectionality, and equality while engaging directly with the communities that are most impacted by them. Because of the pandemic, 2021’s ASB was more informal than previous years. This year’s program—led by Ruby Nagashima, assistant director of student leadership and service engagement—did not require an application to participate. The program typically runs from September through April but this year, Student Affairs hosted a six-week program in February and March. Each student was encouraged to find a volunteer opportunity to engage in virtually while attending weekly sessions focused on social justice topics. Each weekly session focused on a new topic, acting as a space for students to engage in dialogue and learn from one another’s experiences. Topics included: In addition to discussions, students participated in activities such as a virtual privilege walk, where participants played an online racing game with different starting points to represent how some people have an unfair advantage that helps them achieve their goals more quickly. “ASB helped me reevaluate my experience as a US citizen when compared to others, which gave me a newfound sense of pride in my identity,” said Will de Melo ’23. “In the future I want to be more perceptive of microaggressions that I or others might be unwittingly saying.” With opportunities to put social justice education into practice, Alternative Spring Break has become a program that promotes lifelong, active global citizenship where participants are empowered to contribute toward building a more just and equitable society. —Nagisa Smalheiser ’21", "categories": ["Undergraduate Academics", "Student Life"], "date_publish": "April 19, 2021", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

That reality was reaffirmed recently when the WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC) approved SUA’s accreditation for another 10 years, using a new streamlined process designed for high-performing institutions. Soka was one of eight colleges and universities—including Caltech, Cal State Long Beach, and UC San Francisco—to earn its accreditation reaffirmation through the new process, known as the Thematic Pathway for Reaffirmation. Institutions that demonstrate consistent evidence of healthy fiscal condition, strong student achievement indicators, and sustained quality performance are eligible to use this path to reaffirmation. SUA, which is marking its 20th year in Aliso Viejo in 2021, received its first accreditation in June 2005, four years ahead of what is typical for a new institution. In its team report in fall 2020, the WSCUC review team concluded: “In sum, SUA truly is a unique institution with a strong reputation, a deeply felt mission, and highly committed students, faculty, staff, administration, and board. The team applauds the institution’s dedication to its many communities and constituencies, and its deep engagement with the process of accreditation and continuous improvement.” The new Thematic Pathway for Reaffirmation (TPR) process is as rigorous as the standard institutional review, according to the WSCUC. During the streamlined process, institutions can focus on self-selected themes that advance their mission, coordinate with their strategic planning, and promote institutional improvement. “Our growing use of student success outcomes and benchmarking data helps WSCUC concentrate on improvement, results and burden reduction,” WSCUC President Jamienne S. Studley said in a release. “We appreciate the collaboration of the first TPR schools to turn this innovation into reality.” Tomoko Takahashi, vice president for institutional research and assessment and dean of the Graduate School, spearheaded Soka’s accreditation review process. Takahashi, Soka’s accreditation liaison officer since 2001, was elected a WSCUC commissioner in 2015. “I would like to thank all of the members of the SUA community who contributed to this successful outcome,” said SUA President Ed Feasel, “with special recognition to Tomoko for her excellent leadership in guiding us through the process.”", "categories": ["Campus News"], "date_publish": "April 13, 2021", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

{"newspaper": "soka-news", "url": "https://www.soka.edu/news-events/news/moved-by-nature-outdoor-education", "title": "“Moved by Nature”: Outdoor Education and the Co-Existence of Nature and Humanity", "text": "On a cold January day, a dozen Soka students waded into the frigid Øresund Strait in Denmark to fish for shrimp and collect data. They’d spent the morning in the Øresund Aquarium learning about European marine life and the aquarium’s educational programs, and now they measured the water’s temperature and wind speed. More important, they were experiencing a typical day in the life of a Danish seventh-grader. Like many schools in northern Europe, an increasing number of Danish schools have implemented udeskole —outside school—into their curriculum. Last January, the Soka students and Environmental Studies Professor Deike Peters traveled to Scandinavia to study outdoor education and its role in fostering co-existence of nature and humanity. The trip was part of the “Moved by Nature” Learning Cluster co-developed by Prof. Peters and Kentaro Shintaku ’23. The clusters, which take place during a three-and-a-half week period in January, are designed for Soka students to collaborate with professors to explore complex issues. Faculty and students co-design these unique courses during the Fall semester and often travel across California and the world to study these topics and develop solutions together. Prof. Peters and the students spent 10 days in Denmark and Sweden, conducting interviews with educators and working with children in nature-based schools. Students created a website Moved by Nature and a short film to document their findings. Research has shown that substantial time spent in outdoor environments promotes overall well-being and positive environmental values among children, as well as instills concern for the environment. Studies have also shown that children who grow up attending these schools have better motor skills and focus, and develop healthy lifelong habits. Despite this, modern national education systems—especially in Western countries like the United States—tend to emphasize the importance of math, science, and verbal skills when measuring intelligence. This often stunts children’s development in other areas. Dubbed natureskola in Swedish and udeskole in Danish, nature schools challenge this status quo. They’re quickly becoming a popular alternative to typical preschool and kindergarten. Since the 1950s, when the concept was developed by Gösta Frohm, a Swede, nature schools have embraced friluftsliv (literally: “free air life”), holding classes in the forest and focusing on learning through play. More than 300 nature schools are operating across Scandinavia, and other countries are following suit. While conducting school in nature is not feasible everywhere, there are many local governments and non-profit organizations in the United States that are working to make it more accessible. In 2016, Oregon voters passed a measure authorizing funds from the state lottery to provide all fifth- or sixth-grade students in Oregon access to a week of Outdoor School. In California, organizations like Exploring New Horizons offer elementary and middle schools a three-to-five day outdoor education opportunity along the central coast. With the rate of climate change rapidly increasing, incorporating outdoor exploration and learning in early childhood may be more important than ever before to the creative co-existence of nature and humanity. Shintaku had some experience with outdoor education in his own childhood. He grew up in a small town in Hokkaido, Japan—an island known for volcanoes, natural hot springs, and snow. He graduated from a forest kindergarten where “classes” were often held in the forest. Established in 2002 by Mikihiko Yamamoto, the school encourages children to explore, play, and learn outdoors. Shintaku continued his education at an English language school opened by SUA alumnus Nitesh Sil ’11, where he first learned about Soka’s humanistic education. He was inspired by Makiguchi—the founder of Soka Education—and found many similarities in the student-centered pedagogies. “My dream attending Soka University has been to create research that combines my love of nature and a Soka education,” Shintaku said. The “Moved by Nature” Learning Cluster class was the perfect opportunity to dig deeper into the topics and share this passion with other students. Maddie Reitz ’22—one of the other student researchers in the group—has been deeply involved in Outdoor School in her home state of Oregon, both as a young student and a leader in high school. “Being from a relatively rural area myself, it was really illuminating to see how green spaces for play and learning had been introduced to big cities,” she said. “This Learning Cluster has encouraged me to keep pursuing questions of how best to educate our youth and address inequalities when it comes to educational opportunities.” —Nagisa Smalheiser ’21", "categories": ["Learning Clusters", "Environmental Studies", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "December 10, 2020", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

And each year, the council—consisting of a president, vice president, attorney general, treasurer, and secretary—chose a theme to guide them. For the 2020-21 academic year, the council decided on the theme: “We hear you. One campus, One mission—for Humanity.” All three parts of the slogan have particular meaning to the student leaders. The first—we hear you—embodies the EC’s relationship to its fellow students and to each other, committed to hearing every student’s voice and facilitating more constructive discussions to better the community as a whole. The second part of the theme—one campus, one mission—is particularly resonant this year. Although physically separated from each other, the student body is a community and committed to the same mission: “to foster a steady stream of global citizens committed to living a contributive life.” The final phrase—for humanity—acknowledges the students’ global vision. “As aspiring global citizens, our passion goes beyond ourselves—beyond the walls of SUA,” SSU President Shunji Fueki said. The EC builds on its mission through activities such as creating newsletters, coordinating, managing Student Leaders Assembly, reaching out to individual students, and representing undergraduate students at various campus initiatives. The student leaders are also taking a part in planning a hybrid semester in spring.

{"newspaper": "soka-news", "url": "https://www.soka.edu/news-events/news/prof-karen-moran-jackson-awarded-aera-fellowship-study-deeper-learning", "title": "Prof. Karen Moran Jackson Awarded AERA Fellowship to Study Deeper Learning", "text": "Karen Moran Jackson, assistant professor of educational psychology and assessment, has received a fellowship from the American Educational Research Association to advance her research on deeper learning in secondary schools. One of five fellows chosen from a highly competitive pool of early career scholars, Prof. Moran Jackson will build her research on the American Institutes for Research (AIR) Study of Deeper Learning data set. Fellows receive $25,000 in research support and work closely with AIR scientists and other scholars to analyze the data and shape their research. They also have opportunities to participate in research training activities, small conferences, and the AERA Annual Meeting. Made possible by a $1.5 million grant from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the fellowships aim to create a community of scholars studying the Deeper Learning model and a body of research related to the data. Each fellow is developing a research project focused on students, teachers, and schools that implement the Deeper Learning model. SUA spoke with Prof. Moran Jackson about her project and the award. How do you define deeper learning, and how long has it been a topic researchers have studied? Deeper learning theory investigates the development of learning competencies in children that prepare them for dynamic future environments. We know students need more than surface level knowledge, so deeper learning in schools emphasizes experiences that develop cognitive and critical thinking skills, interpersonal abilities, and self-knowledge. All of these competencies have been discussed in education for years. But the current line of research looks at how schools can create meaningful educational experiences that further these competencies with an understanding of ensuring educational equity. What sparked your own interest in the topic? I have always been interested in how we teach not only class content knowledge, but also skills students can use either in their own lives and in their future work. Also, the data for this study come from secondary schools similar to the school I first taught at that used alternative assessments, like portfolios and presentations. My experience teaching at that school was really joyful because of the emphasis we had on student development and growth, beyond test score achievement. So I really liked the idea of being able to do research on a set of schools that had a similar mission. Tell us about the research you will be doing as an AERA Fellow. The AIR’s Deeper Learning dataset contains information on a group of US secondary schools that have implemented missions and structures to promote deeper levels of learning for their students. My study will explore what classroom assessments look like in these schools and how teachers think their values align with assessments. The research will use a mixed-methods design, addressing research questions with qualitative and quantitative data from several sources such as teacher interviews, administrator interviews, and student surveys. The findings will hopefully extend the research literature on teacher assessment attitudes and practices in secondary schools and may explain how school structures can encourage the use of alternative assessment strategies. Are there conflicts between assessment tests and teacher values? Not necessarily. There are different types of school-based assessments, just as there are different values teachers hold onto. Where there can be conflict is when a school system encourages a type of assessment that does not align with teacher values. For example, some teachers don’t believe in ranking students, yet the schools they work in might conduct assessments that require ranking students. Other teachers might be in schools where there is no standardized testing, yet they might value the type of comparative data that such testing can provide teachers. I am interested in how teachers think about their values in relation to the types of assessments they either elect to use with their students or might be required to administer. How long do you expect this research to take, and is it part of a larger ongoing study? This is broadly part of another study as it uses data already collected. The AIR collected data on 20 high schools in the US that implemented aspects of a deeper learning framework. I will be reading and analyzing the interviews AIR conducted with teachers and administrators working at those schools, as well as survey data. The fellowship is scheduled to last a year and a half.", "categories": ["Research", "Faculty News", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "February 08, 2021", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

The discussion will also delve into the Vital Sounds Initiative , the organization’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, how world-renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma became involved, and the profound impact the music has on the people hearing it and the musicians performing the concerts. “I can personally testify that when we’re looking for meaning and purpose at a time when many of the usual avenues of expression are not open for us to explore […] this is actually one of the best things one can do as a musician during this crucial time when people need you.” — YO-YO MA Janss will also discuss the upcoming Yamaha documentary film highlighting Project: Music Heals Us and the importance and ability of music to bring people together and provide healing for those in need. A question and answer session will follow the interview. The event is FREE but Registration is required on Zoom.

About Project: Music Heals Us Now in its seventh season, Project: Music Heals Us aims to democratize access to the healing potential of compassionate human connection through live arts performance, creation, and learning. Since its founding in 2014, PMHU has presented over 1,000 free concerts and educational programs in hospitals, correctional facilities, shelters and refugee centers. In the midst of COVID-19, PMHU launched the Vital Sounds Initiative, providing over $100,000 in musician support to artists, arts organizations and ensembles around the country to provide live, one-on-one, digital bedside concerts to isolated hospital patients across the country. The Initiative addresses two concurrent sources of desperation affecting two seemingly unrelated groups: Isolated COVID patients and their care-givers, and performing artists who have had their livelihoods threatened by the shutdown of live arts programming.

In an email to the Soka community, Executive Vice President Ed Feasel said that SUA is supporting and joining efforts by other higher education institutions to push back against the new regulations that would force international students taking online-only classes in the fall to leave the country. Many education leaders nationwide have expressed grave concerns about the timing and direction of the changes in the Department of Homeland Security’s Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP, as well how it presents inconsistent guidance in accordance with guidelines provided by the US Centers for Disease Control and the California Department of Public Health. Harvard and MIT have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration and a similar suit by the California State universities and the UC system appears to be imminent. “We are hopeful that this growing outcry of support against this new guidance will help work towards an injunction that will lead to an overturning of the new rule,” Feasel wrote in the email. Soka University will also sign onto an American Council on Education letter to Congress asking the Department of Homeland Security to withdraw the guidance and allow flexibility for institutions and students. “The letter also asks Congress to take swift legislative action to protect the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) status of any international students if DHS is unwilling to withdraw the problematic guidance,” Feasel wrote. “I will also personally be sending letters to our senators and local US Congressional representatives requesting similar support from them.” While the health and well-being of the Soka community continues to be a top priority, the university is continuing to investigate options to help support international students who are affected. The policy puts the university in a difficult position in that its decision to offer online-only instruction as a precaution against spreading the coronavirus could harm international students by exposing them to deportation. Some impacted students may want to return to their home countries immediately given these new developments. Feasel asked the Office of Financial Aid to develop a process for providing additional financial assistance, depending on students’ financial need, for travel for international students who want to return home. The concrete process for applying for these funds will be communicated to these students as soon as possible. Soka is also considering the possibility of limited hybrid instruction for international students to work within the new federal guidelines. However, there is not enough clarity on the new requirements, and state and local officials have not issued guidance for how to safely offer in-person education. Soka will continue monitoring the situation and discussing possible actions as requirements become clearer. The potential limited hybrid offering would not include on-campus housing. Soka will share further developments as they become available. “We want to reaffirm our commitment to our community, that we are doing all that we can to provide options within our reach,” Feasel wrote. “We appreciate your support and patience as we continue to work through this challenging moment in time.”", "categories": ["Campus News"], "date_publish": "July 10, 2020", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Great news was just announced! Tuesday at a court hearing regarding an action filed by Harvard and MIT requesting a temporary restraining order against the new policy, the government agreed to rescind the July 6, 2020, directive. This means the government reverts back to a March guidance that allowed international students to remain in the US while taking a fully online course load. The new direction is intended to be applied on a nationwide basis which includes SUA students. Soka University of America joined many other US institutions and leaders nationwide in opposing the policy. Last week Soka signed an American Council on Education letter encouraging senators and Congressional representatives to withdraw the DHS guidance. Soka also joined amicus briefs (friend of the court) supporting lawsuits by the state of California and UC system, which now no longer will be necessary. This is a victory not only for our international students but also for our entire Soka community! For those international students currently residing in the US who are still planning to return home, our financial aid office will continue to provide the additional support I outlined when the new SEVP guidelines were introduced. Further details on this financial aid assistance, including by when students must apply, will be sent directly to affected students by Andrew Woolsey, Dean of Enrollment Services. The health and well-being of our students and community continues to be the top priority for us. We will continue to send updates as warranted. Sincerely, -Ed Edward M.

Furthermore, I extend my lasting appreciation and congratulations to your families for supporting your decision to enroll in SUA. As to Ed Feasel, our new university president, as well as to the faculty, administrative staff, and the entire student body, I ask all of you whom I trust implicitly—join me in the care and counsel of our newly enrolled students, for they are truly exceptional and represent the jewels of humanity. Construction of the much-anticipated Marie and Pierre Curie Hall has finally been completed and courses of the Life Sciences concentration are about to commence. Allow me therefore to offer a few words of encouragement on this day from which you set forth anew with stout hearts filled with the exhilaration of tackling new challenges—words that I hope to share as if I stand before you at this very moment, meeting your gaze and etching each and every one of your vibrant, valiant faces in the depths of my life. Humanity today is beset by a multitude of difficulties, from the pandemic to climate change and other natural disasters. Where then are we to discover the key to unlocking a way out of this vexing age to a brighter future? Among the many conclusions I reached in my dialogues with such globally recognized thinkers as the historian Arnold J. Toynbee, is that they held faith in the creative energy dwelling deep within a person’s life and in the capacity of humanistic education to draw out and direct such energy. The futurist Hazel Henderson is also a believer, insisting that “as long as we keep our faith, adversity provides a favorable wind for growth,” and that every crisis can serve as an opportunity for great change. Dr. Henderson herself had braved opposition and obstacles in her battle against serious environmental pollution; moreover, she has been tireless as an activist for and leader of a grassroots civic movement to advance sustainable development. She stands among the many who look to this university with unbounded expectations. SUA was founded as an institute of higher learning as a beacon to cast the light of hope upon the twenty-first century. Nothing has ever prevented the university from graduating a steady procession of capable individuals to forge paths for the creation of new value for our world. SUA was never daunted by the fear and uncertainty that rose from 9/11 terrorist attacks that occurred soon after this institution opened, by the global financial crisis that followed, by any ensuing maelstrom since then. In carrying out your studies, I realize that the pandemic will prove challenging, having to take classes online, just to cite one example. Yet, all that you learn and experience despite such difficulties will nourish the profound creative energy that you possess, enabling you to apply it to maximum effect. A youthful life resolved to continue learning, come what may, can never be defeated. Nelson Mandela and I envisioned young global citizens uniting to uphold equality and human dignity for all. A towering champion of human rights who altered the course of history through dialogue to facilitate nonviolence, Madiba * stated that one of the most difficult things in life is “changing yourself.” Soka Education is this grand challenge: to realize this most arduous quest for what we term “human revolution” not only for oneself but for others, to better our respective societies and countries, to eventually transform even the destiny of all humanity. To the members of faculty, staff, fellow students, and alumni who have gathered here under the sublime principles upon which SUA was founded, I ask that you remain forever true to this quest. Do so with wisdom, patience, and joy as you strive to hone yourselves while encouraging one another, to advance as one. My abiding hope is that you will go forth, growing ever more capable, to become stalwart pioneers in the creation of a truly new global civilization. May you all, without exception, lead lives of triumph and success in good health. Daisaku Ikeda Founder, Soka University of America August 10, 2020 *Mr. Ikeda makes reference to “Madiba,” a term of endearment conveying respect and affection for Mr. Mandela and is his family ancestral name.", "categories": ["Founder's message", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "August 12, 2020", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Do you wonder how US colleges plan to reopen after the pandemic? Ever contemplate Bigfoot’s relationship to the Kraken? Can you imagine a world without the threat of nuclear catastrophe? Those are some of the 27 topics students explored this year through Soka University of America’s Learning Cluster program. One of SUA’s singular features, a Learning Cluster is an intensive three-and-half-week session conducted during winter block. The courses are co-designed by students and faculty and allow a deeper examination of subjects of all kinds. Learning Cluster is a mandatory course for first- and second-year students and an optional one for third-year students. Enrollment this year hit an all-time high, as most of the study-abroad programs that third-year students typically participate in were cancelled because of the pandemic. In the past, some Learning Cluster courses have been opportunities to travel around the country and world to conduct research. But as SUA heads into its third semester of mostly online instruction, the experience had to be reinvented online. Professors found creative ways to keep their students engaged, including watching films and videos together or inviting guest speakers to offer their perspectives. One professor asked a student who’s studying Japanese American identity to lead a discussion about language and identity. Another introduced students to gather.town , an online platform where they created avatars and interacted virtually. If you are interested in learning more, please contact Learning Cluster Coordinator Seiji Takaku . Why Do We Hate: Holocaust – Prof. Robert Allinson A white 20-year-old enters a church in Charleston, South Carolina, and kills nine African Americans. A gunman storms a gay club in Florida and kills 49. A young white man enters a Pittsburgh synagogue during a worship service and kills 11 people. We know the brutal details of police killings of Eric Garner, George Floyd, Breanna Taylor, and too many others. Why has hatred become so commonplace? Who are the persecutors, bystanders, and rescuers? This course was a highly relevant educational experience of investigation and problem solving for students living and working in an increasingly polarized world. The Politics of Disneyland – Prof. Peter Burns Disneyland opened July 17, 1955, in Anaheim, Calif., and this course looked at the relationship between the park and the city through the lens of politics and policy. The course also sought to understand the impact of the political messaging contained within Disneyland itself and the social and economic consequences of the park’s existence. Students watched videos together and took virtual tours, as well as examined how COVID-19 has affected the park. Emergency Management – Prof. George Busenberg Focusing on the management of a wide array of major hazards facing the world community, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the course used case studies of major disasters to provide insights into the principles and practical challenges of emergency management. A student team project focused on handling complex humanitarian emergencies. Pleasure Activism – Prof. Ryan Ashley Caldwell How do we make social justice the most pleasurable human experience? How can we awaken within ourselves desires that make it impossible to settle for anything less than a fulfilling life? Constructed around Adrienne Maree Brown’s edited works, Pleasure Activism to Emergent Strategy , students in this course used the approach of pleasure activism to reclaim their time, space, and whole happy selves from the effects, delusions, and limitations of oppression and/or supremacy in its many intersectional forms. Data Analysis & Visualization – Prof. Monika Calef By creating their own datasets and analysis, students learned how to answer their own spatial questions. The class walked students through data collection and finding datasets online, as well as how to process data in spreadsheets, manually and with formulas, so they can be visualized in graphs. Students also mapped data online to show spatial patterns. Multilingualism and Identity – Prof. Pablo Camus-Oyarzun It is no secret that humans are fully equipped to learn and function in more than one language. It’s seen through the prevalence of multilingualism around the world. Students explored the complex, multifaceted, and even contradictory ways in which humans learn and use language; and how languages play a key role in the construction of self-identity. Hybridity in Creative Writing – Prof. Darin Ciccotelli What happens when we write creatively without thinking about genre? Are we restricted by the traditional conceptions of an essay, a poem, or a story? This course explored hybridity in contemporary creative writing, focusing on cross-genres such as prose poetry, the lyric essay, epistolaries, flash fiction, performative texts, visual hybrids, and autofiction. Students participated in an intensive writing process, inventing new work and finding their own respective voices. The course also discussed how such hybridity has allowed disenfranchised and subjugated writers to envision their particular identities. Diet and Disease – Prof. Lisa Crummett The world is experiencing a surge in metabolic disease that most experts associate with an “industrial diet” that has been exported from the United States around the globe. This course examined how we can prevent these diseases (type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, obesity), and even reduce the risk of death from COVID-19, by educating ourselves on what foods contribute to disease. Students discussed readings from various books and journal articles, watched documentaries, invited guest speakers, carried out student-designed food experiments, and learned how to cook healthy meals together. COVID-19 and Inequalities – Prof. Danielle Denardo COVID-19 has highlighted and worsened many enduring societal fault lines in terms of race/ethnicity, gender, sexuality, (dis)ability, health, and more. Students in this LC explored these inequalities and how they have been impacted by and have shaped the pandemic. Emphasis was placed on critically examining COVID-19 through an intersectional lens and coming up with ideas for action and change, implementing them when possible. Gender Violence in War – Prof. Sarah England Since the 1990s when the United Nations Security Council and the International Criminal Courts in the former Yugoslavia and in Rwanda began to recognize rape as a strategic weapon of war, there has been growing academic, policy, and media interest in conflict-related gender-based violence (CRGBV). Students in this course studied the history of how this concept has been conceptualized by the international human rights community and by primarily feminist scholars, the ideologies of gender and sexuality that are connected to these forms of violence, and the way that the local, national, and international community have responded to this problem. On Campus During COVID-19 – Prof. Robert Hamersley In this course, students learned about the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, and the COVID-19 disease that it causes, using a case-study approach to examine the reopening plans of peer universities, how they were implemented, and their successes and failures. Based on what they learned, the students made recommendations about SUA’s back to campus plans, and prepared educational materials to help ensure a successful return of students to campus. Being Human in STEM – Prof. Nidanie Henderson-Stull This course explored how Soka and other students experience science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), through individual and collective identities and intersections. They articulated their personal Being Human in STEM stories and ground their understanding in academic literature. They surveyed articles on diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM and interrogated ideas of scientific objectivity by studying the feminist philosophy of science and indigenous ways of knowing. They designed and implemented an oral history research project to articulate STEM narratives from the SUA community, from which responsive interventions are formulated and shared to bring about systemic change within the broader campus and STEM community. This course was modeled on the national Being Human in STEM curriculum and offered in partnership with SUA’s Center for Race, Ethnicity, and Human Rights. Abandoned People & Democracy – Prof. Dongyoun Hwang Drawing on the concept of “abandoned people” who, according to Okinawan peace activist and writer Nishioka Nobuyuki, have been the victims of state violence or have been marginalized, neglected, and discriminated against in a number of ways by authorities such as the state, the students in this course examined why and how they have not been protected by the state and their voices have been buried. The students gave particular attention to those in East Asia who have been socially alienated under the state’s economic drive, the victims of wartime atrocities, and the victims of state violence, and suggested a rethinking of the meaning of democracy and the importance of minor voices in practicing it. Languages of the World – Prof. Osamu Ishiyama This course was built around Okinawan peace activist and writer Nishioka Nobuyuki’s concept of abandoned people—those who have been victims of state violence or marginalized, neglected, and discriminated against by state authorities. Students examined why and how these people have not been protected and had their voices silenced. The students gave particular attention to those in East Asia who have been socially alienated under the state’s economic drive, the victims of wartime atrocities state violence, and suggested a rethinking of the meaning of democracy and the importance of full participation. Leadership & Followership – Prof. Jennifer Lee Students in this course examined the psychology of leadership and followership from a systems perspective and studied their own behaviors in groups. Through experiential exercises and self-inquiry, students investigated the ways they take up their roles as leaders and followers, how they relate to formal authority, and how they exercise their own personal authority in groups. The aim of this course was to foster self-awareness through the examination of social identities, unconscious biases towards authority, and valances towards specific roles within a group. SARS-CoV-2: Molecular-Global – Prof. Robert Levenson This course focused on exploring the molecular nature of SARS-CoV-2, the virus which is the cause of the COVID-19 disease. Students investigated the molecular biology of viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, examining the causes and impacts of other epidemics like HIV and Ebola to see the lessons they offer, and exploring the new vaccine technologies that will hopefully return us to normalcy soon. Policy to the Pandemic – Prof. Junyi Liu This course surveyed the policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic of about 70 countries. Through a collection of global policy data, students compared government responses to the pandemic, comparing those in categories such as high-income and low-income nations, democratic and authoritarian nations, landlocked and coastal nations. Reports of those comparisons could lead to further and more in-depth research, searching for causal relations, if any, between country characteristics and a relatively successful control of a pandemic. Cryptozoology – Prof. Anthony Mazeroll Cryptids (an animal that there are claims to its existence but does not actually exist) appear in the mythology of most societies around the world. Bigfoot, for instance, or the Loch Ness Monster. Some like the Kraken of sea-faring societies have turned out to be real living creatures. The course discussed the scientific evidence of the cryptids that have been used in mythology, trying to answer the question, Is Cryptozoology science or pseudoscience? Evolution of Natural Patterns – Prof. Marie Nydam Nature is brimming with colors and patterns that we humans recognize as beautiful: a tiger’s stripes, an iridescent bird feather, a coiled snail shell. In this course, the students learned how these colors, patterns and shapes evolved, and why they exist from a biological perspective. Students produced several works of collage and photography, as a parallel path to understanding the natural world. Students in this course and Anne Pearce’s course met together to learn from visiting artists, to learn about patterns as communication between species, and to share patterns of interest. Drawing: Pattern in Nature – Prof. Anne Pearce Students examined a wide range of patterns, textures, and colors found in the natural world, collecting a myriad of source material to serve as a point of departure. Through the act of observational drawing, revision and re-drawing, students completed works of newly evolved patterns uniquely formed and revealed through their eyes and work. In concert with Marie Nydam’s Evolution of Natural Patterns course, students researched and exchanged material. The culminating project was a final drawing that employs the use of pattern and design as its primary focus, celebrating with awe and appreciation what the natural world provides and inspires. Nuclear Weapons Politics – Prof. Tetsushi Ogata On January 22, 2021, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) took effect, outlawing nuclear weapons. And yet immediate prospects for translating that vision into reality are still bleak. In this course students explored issues surrounding the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, the history and politics of nuclear deterrence, strategies of counter-proliferation, assessment of the non-proliferation regime and its safeguards system, and debates on peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Folk and Fairy Tales in a Global Context – Prof. Katherine Perry Students read and investigated tales from throughout the world, including Africa, Asia, Central and South America, Egypt, Greek mythology, native America, and western Europe. Students used the stories to learn about different cultures and societies throughout the world. Students also wrote their own fairy tales with modern morals, with the goal of having a positive impact in a global society. Explorations in Ecocinema – Prof. Deike Peters How do films shape our experience about the world and the natural and built environments we live in? How are documentaries different from fiction films or animated films in conveying environmental content? What different kinds of environmental films are there and what exactly do we mean by “ecocinema”? How have wildlife and nature documentaries changed over time? Is all ecocinema activist, or can it also be merely meditative/contemplative or have even other aims? The core emphasis of this course was environmental documentaries released in the last 10-15 years as anthropocentric climate change has begun to loom increasingly large over our global environmental consciousness. Yoga for Transformation – Prof. Nalini Rao Yoga for Psychological Transformation was a path towards ‘self-discovery’ through the usage of tools of concentration, such as postures, meditation, mental concentration, recitation, diagrams, and readings from ancient texts. It hoped to empower individuals to lead a life of values and positive behavior through which they can contribute to being a productive global citizen. Film Theory and Criticism – Prof. Sandrine Simeon This course surveyed major directions in classical and contemporary film theory and criticism with an emphasis on the avant-garde, realism(s), auteurism, gender and race relations (postcolonialism, feminism, masculinity and queer theory, Blaxploitation), film and theater, the spectator, and documentary. It also explored larger issues pertaining to the philosophical, ethical, political, institutional, and cultural domains, and focused on discussing film aesthetics and conducting film analysis to appreciate the fundamental link between form and content. Inclusivity in STEM – Prof. Susan Walsh It is imperative to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in science, not just for PEERs (Persons Excluded because of their Ethnicity or Race), but to eradicate any form of prejudice, including language gap, disabilities, gender, sexuality, and even content-related bias, so all people have an equal opportunity to succeed. Through a curated list of readings, lectures, and podcasts, this course worked to identify the barriers in STEM fields and find solutions that can help eliminate those barriers. By listening to various speakers’ stories about their experiences in STEM, students sought to gain a better understanding of the obstacles in achieving DEI, what kind of approaches can help, and what actions can be taken to improve inclusivity in STEM with the end goal of making an impact in their own lives and through communicating their findings to their communities. Astronomy with SUA Nieves Observatory – Prof. Bryan Penprase In this course, students worked together to explore both the experiential — or subjective — nature of the sky, and also the objective and scientific basis of astronomy, using telescopes — such as the new Nieves Observatory on campus. The observatory has allowed members of the Soka community to take wonderful pictures of the moon, planets, star clusters, nebulae, and galaxies. Students have also taken pictures and time lapse movies of the sky using their cell phones. Along the way they’ve explored the human story of astronomy – and how it has been practiced in nearly all cultures of the world over the centuries. —Nagisa Smalheiser ’21", "categories": ["Learning Clusters", "Undergraduate Academics", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "February 08, 2021", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

{"newspaper": "soka-news", "url": "https://www.soka.edu/news-events/news/faculty-spotlight-katherine-perry-mathematics-research", "title": "Faculty Spotlight: Katherine Perry on Mathematics Research and Outreach in Southern Africa", "text": "Katherine Perry, assistant professor of mathematics, is a long-time participant in an annual mathematics conference and workshop in southern Africa. The Southern African Mathematical Science Association (SAMSA) - Masamu workshop brings together mathematicians from around the world to collaborate, and Perry said that one of her favorite experiences from the program are the “simple conversations held over meals about different ideas, cultures, and mathematics.” That’s similar to Soka, where she is able to interact daily with students and professors from across the globe. Perry, who specializes in graph theory, is currently teaching Linear Algebra, Liberal Arts Math, and Network Science. This year’s event was originally scheduled for November in Maputo, Mozambique, but because of the pandemic will be held virtually. The workshop also welcomes graduate and undergraduate students, which adds to the diversity of the minds working on the problems. Invitation requirements include being familiar with mathematical proofs, and Perry is hopeful she can help Soka students participate in the future. We asked Perry to share more about her experiences with the program over the years. Q: How did you get involved with the Southern African Mathematical Science Association Masamu Program? A: I first was able to attend during my last year of grad school at Auburn University. The program’s founder, Professor Overtoun Jenda, is originally from Malawi. He wanted to start a workshop that fosters collaboration between mathematicians in Africa and other places, especially the US. About 80 researchers get together every year. It is one of those things that’s hard to do virtually—as we’re all learning this year—so it’s really nice to dedicate 10 days to working together. Q: Can you describe what you do during those 10 days? A: There are several problems floating around that don’t have known solutions, so we get together to try and solve them. Often with mathematics, it goes a lot better if you collaborate with others, which is why I’m always telling my students to talk to each other about the homework and group work we do in class. It can be difficult if you’re trying to do everything on your own. Like Soka, the Masamu Program brings together people from different geographic and educational backgrounds. Everyone has been taught mathematics differently depending on where they’re from, which leads to new ideas when we all come together. Q: You first got involved with this workshop when you were in graduate school, and we understand that some undergraduate students are eligible to participate as well. How does that work? A: Yes! Typically, in workshops like this it’s just math faculty, or just graduate students, or just undergraduates. But one thing that’s special about this one is that it’s all levels, which also feeds into this idea of having a diverse group of people. It’s people from everywhere, at various levels in their careers. In the future, I would like to see Soka students there as well. One class I’ll hopefully teach next year is an introduction to proofs—how to formally make a mathematical argument. Once students have that background, they can go on to look at problems that people don’t know the answers to. Students who have that background and are interested in research would really benefit from something like this. New people are always encouraged to go, and I think it would be really cool. Q: Has the workshop influenced the way you teach? A: In mathematics, we are often told that there’s only one way to solve a problem. Not only is the answer 5, but you have to have followed these exact steps to get there. And I don’t like that way of thinking. There are usually multiple ways to solve a problem, and as long as an answer is correct, it doesn’t really matter how you get there. And that’s something I try to emphasize in class. When students ask for help, I also like to be more vague about the solutions sometimes because I don’t like the idea of saying ‘This is how you have to do something.’ I think that stunts students’ creativity and you need creativity in order to do math well. It’s a balance. —Nagisa Smalheiser ’21", "categories": ["Research", "Mathematics", "Faculty News"], "date_publish": "November 24, 2020", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

{"newspaper": "soka-news", "url": "https://www.soka.edu/news-events/news/adams-finding-purpose", "title": "Committed to Serve: Stuart Adams ’16 Finds Purpose in the Line of Fire", "text": "For 56 days in a row last fall, Stuart Adams ’16 met the other members of his crew at base camp, ate a quick breakfast, grabbed a sack lunch, donned his PPE, and headed to the fire lines. On one of those days in September, as the North Complex Fire tore through forests north of Sacramento, Adams’ crew cleared brush to create a buffer lane to stop the approaching flames. They lit a fire to burn out a section of terrain in front of them, a standard firefighting practice. But the wind picked up and the fire grew quickly—so quickly that Adams and the rest of the crew had to race out of danger. It was one of the most challenging days Adams has experienced since he joined the California Department of Fire Protection (CalFire) in July, a few months before the start of the worst wildfire season in California history. At first glance, firefighting seems an unusual occupation for someone who entered SUA with the overarching goal of preparing for a career that brings more peace to the world. Adams doesn’t see it that way. “Peace is not a term that relates to the absence of warfare, but an active word,” he said. “I always knew I wanted to be a public servant.” Adams, who grew up in Albany, Calif., a town on the San Francisco Bay, didn’t have a concrete career goal when he was applying to college. He did know that whatever path he would follow would need to contribute to a more peaceful world. That led him to Soka. “I knew SUA’s liberal arts education,” he said, “would give me the base I needed no matter what I did.” Once on campus, Adams began to focus on a career in international relations, politics, or activism. Seeing the “nastiness and vitriol in electoral politics,” during the 2016 presidential election changed his mind. Adams had taken an emergency management Learning Cluster at SUA but hadn’t thought much more about it until after he’d graduated, while working at an unsatisfying job in finance. Helping people in times during natural or manmade disasters would allow him to be the kind of public servant he aspired to become: one who served others without regard to their beliefs, socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, or anything else that can cause division. Adams enrolled in an EMT program that included training in firefighting. Things began to click into place. “The fire service really serves as the backbone for emergency response in the US,” he said. “I really have a lot of respect for people who work on the front lines.” While working part-time as an EMT on an ambulance crew, he attended the fire academy. Adams isn’t joking when he says he “knew from my whole experience at SUA that I could handle the fire academy.” “When I was doing my capstone, I had really struggled because I had delayed getting started,” he said. “I had to learn time management to get it done while keeping up with my extracurricular activities, because I was involved in multiple things. The skills I developed then taught me how to look at the situation in front of me and determine what I can do right now to complete a task, and not get overwhelmed.” He was working 40 hours a week as an EMT while completing the academy in March when the pandemic broke out. Adams marshalled the determination he’d developed in college. “While I was in the fire academy, nobody who knew me saw me,” he said. “I was always working. I had to remind myself how much I wanted it. What I learned this year is that the peace we aspire to may not happen. It is not guaranteed. Because SUA aspires to create it, they do not play around. You need to have that strength of conviction, even when circumstances seem dire.” On days like the one he experienced in September, his training as a firefighter gives him the confidence he needs. “We are taught how to act in situations that are unsafe,” he said. “But it is not everyday you encounter them, so you can’t get that kind of practice. You have to train and study them.” During his rookie year with CalFire, the crew’s camaraderie, and a good dose of gallows humor, kept Adams going on long days. CalFire is diverse and egalitarian, he says, and he appreciates the firefighters’ shared commitment to their jobs. “I have really good relationships with people I work with,” he said. “You have to have imaginative empathy for everyone. Not just the people who are like you.” As the fire season winds down, Adams is grateful for the experience and looking ahead. “This on-the-ground experience will inform the further training and education that I do,” said Adams, who expects to spend a few more years with CalFire before applying to graduate school to earn a degree in public administration, and to work on the policy and planning side of emergency management. “I recognize that I have had a lot of things given to me—growing up in a safe family, my education—and I have always been concerned about the people around me,” he said. “Because of who I am and the things I have, and am thankful for, I can use that in my work. I can contribute to upholding the dignity of each person.”", "categories": ["Alumni"], "date_publish": "December 10, 2020", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

In a candid, but informative, atmosphere, Thompson-Hernández discussed his work focusing on the exploration of belonging. His talk was followed by an interaction with a panel composed of three SUA students and Prof. Tomas Crowder-Taraborelli. The panel addressed and questioned important and current issues related to culture appropriation, the concept of belonging in subcultures, questioning of stereotypes, and the act of healing. Robert Allinson, professor of philosophy In honor of World Philosophy Day, for the 12th year, Professor Allinson hosted a historic civil rights documentary, “I Shall Not be Silent: Jaochim Prinz.” Philosophy is the only academic discipline UN/UNESCO honors for its critical, rational training that provides conceptual bases of principles and values on which world peace depends: democracy, human rights, respect, equality, and justice for all. The discussion afterward focused on “can we ever really understand the ‘Other’?” Professor Allinson’s students in the Good, Evil, and the Holocaust course attended the play, “I Never Saw Another Butterfly” at the Laguna Playhouse. The play tells the story of Theresienstadt Concentration Camp where of 15,000 children only 141 survived. Raja (a Czech teenager and others) smuggled out of the camp many poems and art work so that the lives of the murdered children continue to inspire the world today.

Ambassador Anwarul Chowdhury, former permanent representative of Bangladesh to the UN, chaired the event. Ambassador Chowdhury’s life’s work is to share the “value of peace and equality as the essential components of our existence.” His message was one of encouragement, that every individual must work to realize their highest potential and become an agent of peace and nonviolence. He discussed the United Nations’ 1999 Declaration and Programme of Action on Culture of Peace, the historic, norm-setting document that is considered one of the most significant legacies of the UN. In 1998 and 1999 Ambassador Chowdhury chaired the arduous, nine-month negotiations that led to the agreement, which outlines everything the international community has agreed on as the focus of a culture of peace, highlighting education, women, children, and communities. Participants at the Soka event in October heard presentations from people with diverse backgrounds involved in both practical and intellectual work to advance the cause of peace. In the words of Ambassador Chowdhury: “The work for peace is a continuous process. Each of us can make a difference in that process. Peace cannot be imposed from outside; it must be realized from within. Let us embrace the culture of peace for the good of humanity, for the sustainability of our planet, and for making our world a better place to live.”", "categories": ["International Studies", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "October 07, 2019", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Gruwell appeared with three of the original student Freedom Writers, celebrating the 20th anniversary of publication of their New York Times bestselling book, The Freedom Writers Diary. Many may remember Gruwell as the idealistic 23-year-old English teacher at Wilson High School in Long Beach, California, who was confronted with a room of “unteachable, at-risk” students. Determined to make a difference, Gruwell helped 150 students change the course of their lives by connecting across cultures and continents and writing about it. Armed with pens and notebooks, the Freedom Writers challenged themselves and the education system to stop ignoring them. Their story resulted in the popular book, a movie starring Hilary Swank, and a PBS documentary released this year. Gruwell is also founder of the Freedom Writers Foundation, whose mission is to advocate for students and teachers by providing tools that facilitate student-centered learning, improve overall academic performance, and increase teacher retention. Anna Lane, a member of the Soka master’s program in Educational Leadership and Societal Change, introduced Gruwell at the event, reminiscing, “I remember watching the movie about Erin and the Freedom Writers when I was in college to become a teacher. I watched it alone, and remember crying and feeling so encouraged to pursue my dream of fighting for social justice in education, which eventually brought me here to study at Soka.” Lane added that Gruwell’s “work aligns so much with the spirit of our university founder, Dr. Daisaku Ikeda, who shares with us about developing the ability to connect beyond gender, class, race, and nationality. Doing this is no easy task. It takes self-reflection, courage, and the determination to engage in dialogue.” In addition to meeting Gruwell, the audience enjoyed the reflections of three of the original Freedom Writers, Kanya Sim, Shanita Jones, and Shanate Jones. After the event, many audience members stayed to have books and programs autographed. “Erin Gruwell and the Freedom Writers taught me that it is important to never give up on anyone,” Lane said. “As educators, we have a responsibility to try and bring hope to students and to not be discouraged by the immediate environment or circumstance we are faced with.”", "categories": ["Critical Conversations", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "October 18, 2019", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Even though we still have no reported cases of COVID-19 at SUA, we have a responsibility to maintain a safe and healthy campus and at the same time continue with our fundamental purpose of delivering the best quality education. Given recent developments over the last several days, and in line with recent action taken by many of our local peer institutions, we have made the difficult decision to have students return home and to remain home for the remainder of the semester. We ask all students to vacate the residence halls by March 27. Students who have extenuating circumstances that prevents them from returning home should submit a petition to our Dean of Students, Hyon Moon. Only upon a strict review and approval process will a student be allowed to stay on campus. All courses will continue online through the end of the semester in May (or the end of the Bridge program in late April) to assure a high quality of instruction for students so they can complete the semester/program within the regular academic calendar. The academic administration and IT are all working together so our faculty can use online platforms effectively to provide quality online courses and prevent disruption to your course of study. As a reminder, student employees are not permitted to work remotely. If you have any questions about student employment, please contact studentjobs@soka.edu . Students who return home from campus and are subject to a status change in enrollment will receive a pro-rated housing cost for the spring semester. Information regarding potential financial aid adjustments will be communicated in the coming weeks. Students who were on study abroad in Europe have already been notified that they will be returning to their home countries effective immediately. In addition, all academic support and student services will be moved online beginning March 23 through the end of the semester (or the end of the Bridge program). In lieu of in-person meetings, we will be utilizing Microsoft Teams. Some offices already have the capability to hold virtual meetings. Other offices will be able to use Microsoft Teams from March 23. Other activities that do not require a face-to-face meeting will continue in the manner in which they are normally done now. To prevent the possible group transmission of the COVID-19 virus and following the California governor’s recommendation to cancel any gatherings over 250 people, the university has decided to postpone or cancel all in-person university-sponsored events and activities until further notice which unfortunately includes this year’s Commencement Ceremony. Since the majority of our students are not from the local area, and would need to make travel arrangements well in advance for themselves and their families, it was decided to cancel Commencement at this time. Additional information about graduation will be sent out in the coming weeks. Faculty and staff will continue to report to campus for normal business operations. As the situation changes, updates will be announced. Please continue to follow all the CDC recommended guidelines including frequent hand washing and social distancing. University-sponsored travel will be restricted to essential travel only, and everyone will be required to monitor both State Department travel advisories and news about all affected areas before traveling. Faculty and staff will need to inform the academic deans or area head/supervisor, respectively, about their personal travel plans as well. As previously communicated, faculty and staff who are not feeling well are to remain home and communicate directly with their supervisor. We know that these new developments are disappointing, but we need to work together to keep our campus community healthy and safe. We will continue to monitor the situation carefully and will keep you informed of any updates and changes. Please stay healthy and take good care.

More information: Update on US Visa Guidelines for International Students This week the Department of Homeland Security announced updates to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), federal regulations that will affect international students taking classes online this fall. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, SEVP had previously authorized a temporary exemption that allowed international students to enroll in their Spring 2020 courses online. This new guidance, announced Monday by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, states nonimmigrant F-1 students attending schools operating entirely online may not continue to take a full online course load and remain in the United States for the upcoming Fall semester. In other words, international students can only be a full-time student and maintain their F-1 visa status this fall if they are residing outside the US. “We were all shocked by this recent news and share in the disappointment and concerns that many of you have expressed with this recent mandate,” SUA Dean of Enrollment Services Andrew Woolsey wrote in an email to the university community today. “We are proud of our students’ spirit and resilience, who in the midst of a global pandemic continue to persevere. Our campus takes deep pride in our international students and values their contributions to our community.” The Office of International Student Services has contacted international students regarding this new guidance and is following up with students directly impacted. Soka is discussing various possibilities for supporting international students and addressing the situation, while remaining in compliance and minimizing student disruption. Please note: This new guidance does not affect international students who are already outside the US and planning to study remotely from their home country this fall. Soka understands the great concern that many people in our community have about these new developments. We will continue to closely monitor any updates. This is an evolving situation, subject to change, and we will provide more information as it becomes available.

{"newspaper": "soka-news", "url": "https://www.soka.edu/news-events/news/discussion-between-daisaku-ikeda-and-nobel-peace-prize-laureate-wangari-maathai", "title": "A Discussion Between Daisaku Ikeda and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Wangari Maathai", "text": "On the afternoon of February 18, 2005, SGI President Ikeda met with renowned Kenyan environmentalist and 2004 Nobel Peace Prize winner Wangari Maathai at the Seikyo Shimbun building in Shinano-machi, Tokyo. The SGI leader and Dr. Maathai agreed on the pressing need for a philosophy of reverence for life and the importance of individual spiritual transformation as the first step to creating a brighter future for humanity. Dr. Maathai’s daughter Wanjira Maathai and Kenyan Ambassador Dennis Awori were also present. Dr. Maathai, who is also Kenya’s assistant environment minister and the founder of the Green Belt Movement, was born in 1940 in the town of Nyeri in central Kenya. She grew up in the beautiful natural setting of the region, which is surrounded by mountains. After extensive study abroad, she received her doctorate from the University of Nairobi, the nation’s leading institution of higher learning, and began a teaching career. In 1977, wishing to help preserve her homeland’s natural environment and improve the lives of the local people, she established the Green Belt Movement as a nongovernmental organization, or NGO. Eventually the movement grew to encompass some one hundred thousand people, predominantly women, and it has been responsible for the planting of more than thirty million trees in Kenya and other parts of Africa. In 1986, it established a Pan-African Green Belt Network, and initiatives inspired by the tree-planting movement have been successfully launched in Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, Lesotho, Ethiopia, and Zimbabwe. Dr. Maathai was elected to Kenya’s parliament in 2002, with 98 percent of the vote, and she currently represents her home region, the Nyeri district. In 2003, she was appointed assistant minister for environment, natural resources, and wildlife. She has been internationally acclaimed for her struggles for democracy, human rights, and environmental conservation, and she has addressed the United Nations on several occasions. The recipient of numerous international awards, Dr. Maathai last year became the first African woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize, in recognition of “her contribution to sustainable development, democracy, and peace.” She also has received honorary doctorates from the University of Norway, Yale University, and several other US institutions of higher learning. She serves on the boards of many prestigious international organizations dedicated to peace, the environment, and women’s rights. Members of the Soka University Pan-African Friendship Association welcomed Dr. Maathai with a rendition of the song “This Is Our Home,” sung in the environmental activist’s native language, Kikuyu. An anthem of the Green Belt Movement, the song includes the lyrics: This is our home Our aim is to plant trees here Our home is a home of womenfolk Come, let’s carry the tree seedlings and plant Swaying to the music, Dr. Maathai responded to the young people’s heartfelt performance with her trademark incandescent smile. SGI President Ikeda: “Karibu! (“Welcome” in Swahili). And congratulations on your Nobel Peace Prize! “It was fifteen years ago that a group of young people and I welcomed former South African president Nelson Mandela in this same building. Today, I have the pleasure of welcoming you, once again with a group of young people. I am very pleased and deeply grateful for this wonderful opportunity.” President Ikeda introduced the young people at the meeting to Dr. Maathai, describing them as the best of youth, dedicated to the goal of serving humanity with such complete devotion as to be worthy of becoming future Nobel laureates themselves. Dr. Maathai started the Green Belt Movement as an attempt to solve the most pressing problems confronting the women of her country: shortages of clean water, nutritious food, and the fuel to cook it. A spiraling cycle of deforestation—forested land in Kenya had dropped from 30 percent to 2 percent of the nation’s total area in a few decades—and the shift from growing food for the local market to cash crops had exacerbated these problems and were quickly leading to an environmental crisis. Dr. Maathai started her grassroots movement by persuading women that planting trees was a way out of poverty. With the motto, “One Person—One Tree,” the movement gathered momentum and, though it faced numerous obstacles such as prejudice, discrimination, and government repression, the Kenyan activist and her compatriots pressed on. The authoritarian government in power at the time, fearing the political repercussions of any popular organization, arrested and imprisoned Dr. Maathai on several occasions. During one peaceful demonstration, she was even beaten to the point of unconsciousness, but in spite of all opposition she refused to abandon her beliefs. As a result of the courageous efforts of Dr. Maathai and her supporters, the Green Belt Movement has transformed Kenya and other parts of Africa, making an important contribution not only to improving the natural environment but also to revitalizing and stabilizing local communities and society in general. Mr. Ikeda: “Dr. Maathai, you are a pioneer of the century of women; and women all over the world applaud your achievements and the well-deserved recognition they have earned you. In the past, men have frequently looked down on and discriminated against women, reacting with envy and spite to those who have accomplished great things. But you have carried out a quiet revolution under the very noses of these ‘uppity men’! “You have overcome all forms of adversity and persecution and scored a magnificent triumph. Each tree you have planted has contributed to the growth of a new century—a century of the environment, of human rights, of the empowerment of women, and of Africa.” During the meeting, Dr. Maathai was presented with the Soka University Award of Highest Honor, and the SGI leader proposed planting two trees in her honor: a cherry tree at Soka University in Japan, to thrive alongside those already planted to honor such great leaders as the late Chinese premier Zhou Enlai, former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev, and the late Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin; and a fig tree at Soka University of America in Aliso Viejo, California. President Ikeda noted that fig trees are very valuable and highly prized in Kenya. Affirming this, Dr. Maathai thanked Mr. Ikeda and said she was extremely honored by this gesture. In fact, a fig tree played a pivotal role in inspiring Dr. Maathai’s environmental activism. Upon returning home to her village from study in the United States, she was pained to discover that many fig trees in her village had been cut down, victims of shortsighted “economic development” at the expense of long-term needs. President Ikeda expressed his hope that Dr. Maathai would visit Soka University and SUA in the future, and she said she looked forward to that opportunity. Dr. Maathai: “I have the deepest admiration and respect for you, President Ikeda, and all SGI members around the world.” Mr. Ikeda: “Thank you.” Dr. Maathai: “I have been following the activities of [the SGI] organization for some time, since I met some of the members during discussions on the Earth Charter. And during that forum, I came to appreciate the values upheld by your group and learned how deeply rooted they are in the teachings of Buddhism, which exhibit a profound respect for life, nature, and human society. Those values also happen to be the very values that we are pursuing in the Green Belt Movement.” Mr. Ikeda: “They are in fact very similar. Buddhism teaches that all plants and trees, and indeed all living things, possess the supreme life condition, which we call the Buddha nature. And Shakyamuni attained his enlightenment while meditating under the bodhi tree, a tree in the fig family.” Dr. Maathai: “I have felt a strong connection with the SGI and its members, and so this moment is very fulfilling for me. I appreciate this opportunity to meet you and share with your organization, because we have common values. I also regard this award from Soka University as the highest honor, and I accept it with tremendous humility and appreciation on behalf of myself and the millions of people who subscribe to and support the values you have continued to propagate throughout your life. You are a great gift to humanity.” Mr. Ikeda: “I am humbled by your kind words.” Dr. Maathai: “I’m so glad for this chance to make personal contact with you and the SGI and to tell you of my wish to take the values you uphold back to the part of the world I come from, to Africa. I would be very happy to work together to share these values with the African people.” Mr. Ikeda: “I plan to continue to do whatever I can for society and humanity. I have met many world leaders in my lifetime, and nothing makes me happier than meeting those leaders who are seriously concerned about humanity’s welfare and future.” Dr. Maathai said that she, too, hoped to continue providing leadership in propagating values that affirmed reverence for life, adding that she regarded promoting such spiritual values as even more important than fulfilling material needs. The SGI leader expressed his hearty agreement with Dr. Maathai, calling it crucial not only for humanity and our times but from an eternal perspective as well. Dr. Maathai shared that she had learned a great deal during her visit, especially citing the Japanese concept of mottainai (literally, “Don’t waste!” expressing a reluctance to waste anything). Since encountering this word, she has spoken of the significance of mottainai on several occasions, which have been widely reported in the Japanese press. Mr. Ikeda: “Thanks to you, the spirit of mottainai has become world famous!” Dr. Maathai: “Mottainai embodies the spirit of respect for nature and using nature responsibly, efficiently, and respectfully, without violating it.” Mr. Ikeda: “That’s right. Human beings may think they are clever, but nothing is more foolish than the delusion that the natural world exists solely for our exploitation and domination. In this regard, in particular, you are a very important voice in today’s world. “Your parents were farmers. You have five siblings and are the oldest daughter. Your parents believed in the importance of education, and you’ve said you were grateful that they saw to it that you attended school. I am deeply moved to think how happy your deceased father and mother must be that their daughter is so greatly honored today. “Would you please, for the sake of our readers, share some memories of your parents? For example, something they scolded or praised you for—anything is fine.” Dr. Maathai: “Certainly. I remember an incident when I was very young. Mountains edged the area where we lived. One morning, I woke up very early and went outside. It was still dark; stars were in the sky. Then suddenly I saw a shooting star, and it scared me. I went back into the house and asked my mother why the sky didn’t fall down. “She told me: ‘The sky won’t ever fall, because in the mountains surrounding our farm live giant buffaloes. And those buffaloes have huge horns with which they hold up the sky. That’s why it will never fall.’ “Child that I was, I thought it was a wonderful story, and didn’t feel afraid anymore. For many years after that, I believed there were buffaloes in the sky, and I remember this story today as a symbol of the wonderful way in which the natural world protects and fosters us.” Mr. Ikeda: “That is quite a wonderful story. We talk a lot about the environment these days, but talk is not enough. An awareness of the environment is absolutely crucial in order to advance rationally in a positive direction—indeed, for the very survival of the human race. “To date, in both government and education, we have failed to cultivate a sufficient awareness of the importance of the environment. While by rights both should be teaching the people about the environment, they have failed to do so. Instead, they have encouraged taking the environment for granted. And that has fatal consequences. We humans pride ourselves on our intelligence, but in fact we are behaving very shortsightedly. “You, Dr. Maathai, have called attention to the importance of protecting and preserving the natural environment. You have discovered this truth and put it into practice in your life. Protecting the environment is the true key to humanity’s progress. The natural world is like a precious bastion protecting our very existence. This is the pioneering way you have pointed out to us and have tirelessly advocated. It is an extremely important achievement. This is no empty compliment; I say it in all sincerity.” Mr. Ikeda: “I heard you once encouraged your son by saying that the difference between success and failure in life is often no more than the willingness to get up when you are down. This is a wonderful philosophy of hope and commitment to victory. And you have demonstrated this victory in your own life as well, calmly and resolutely overcoming numerous trials and tribulations.” Dr. Maathai: “My colleagues in the Green Belt Movement and I are grateful that the Nobel Committee decided to recognize efforts for the environment. And, although the recognition came through me, I know it is an honor bestowed on all who have been working in this area. It sends a powerful message that the environment is vitally important for peace. We can’t have peace if we destroy the environment.” Mr. Ikeda: “I completely agree. By focusing on the environment, you have brought about a tremendous change in consciousness.” Dr. Maathai: “In the Bible, the story of creation starts with the creation of the earth and plant and animal species. Only toward the end were the human species created. To me this says that the rest of creation doesn’t really need our species, but that it is we human beings who need the other species. If humankind had been created first, I usually say, we would have died the following day. That understanding should humble us and make us work hard to protect and preserve all other living things, because our survival depends on their survival. “This understanding, which you and the SGI emphasize and promote, is very important, because once people understand that their lives are sustained by the other species on the planet, they will feel a commitment to preserving them. “This knowledge can be the greatest inspiration for young people. They need to understand that there is no future—the future is now. If they want to see the future, they must act now.” Mr. Ikeda: “The future is now—I was just saying the very same thing the other day. I would like to learn more from you, Dr. Maathai, and to disseminate this wisdom around the world.” Dr. Maathai is not only the first environmental activist but also the first African woman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. The decision of the Nobel Committee to recognize her achievements can also be seen as a call to the world to heed the voice of Africa. The SGI leader has consistently emphasized the importance of making the twenty-first century the Century of Africa, regarding the revitalization of the continent as vital to the achievement of a just global society. Citing the well-known Latin saying that “Something new always comes out of Africa,” Mr. Ikeda noted that Dr. Maathai’s tree-planting movement has illuminated and awakened the human race with the fresh power of women. He then asked his guest what message she would like to send the world from Africa. Dr. Maathai suggested the importance of further studies of Africa as the cradle of the human species, which is widely believed to have originated in East Africa. We may learn, she offered, that the fate of our species is intimately linked to the fate of its birthplace, and if so, the degeneration of the environment in Africa might be an indication that life itself is degenerating. Mr. Ikeda: “Many have commented on your wonderful smile, and several of our students at Soka University and Soka Women’s College have requested that I ask you the secret to such a bright smile.” Dr. Maathai: “We smile when we are happy. When we see the sun, we say that the sky is smiling at us. When we see flowers, we say nature is smiling at us. This world, this life, is a wonderful experience. “We were talking about young people earlier. It’s important to let young people know that they make us smile, too. They need to know that they are a great gift to us and that they have wonderful lives ahead of them. But they must also be made aware that if they want change, they must initiate that change. “At any rate, I believe life is a wonderful experience that we should enjoy.” Mr. Ikeda: “What a positive philosophy! The essence of Buddhism’s message is that we need to strive to become people for whom life is an inherently joyful experience. You are speaking of the importance of transforming oneself—what we call the philosophy of ‘human revolution.’” Dr. Maathai: “Yes. I also believe that we must take care of the environment—starting with our own environment. For I feel that being happy is an expression of the inner happiness that results when all is well with our environment.” Mr. Ikeda: “Your reply reflects a profound philosophy, while at the same time being very down to earth and easy to understand. You have said: ‘I myself am happiest and at my best when I am serving.’ 1 To me this is an expression of a very lofty philosophy of happiness. Those who behave otherwise are sure to be unhappy. You are a genuine philosopher, a superb political activist, and a beacon of hope for others. You are a real world leader.” Dr. Maathai: “Thank you.” Mr. Ikeda: “Some twenty-five hundred years ago, Shakyamuni said: Planters of groves and fruitful trees, And they who build causeway and dam, And wells construct and watering-sheds And to the homeless shelter give: — Of such as these by day and night For ever doth the merit grow. 2 “And in the third century BCE, the great Indian monarch King Ashoka renounced war and established a reign of peace and compassion throughout his extensive realm. He also enacted environmentally friendly policies, planting mango trees for their fruit and shade-giving trees along the country’s roads. Ashoka is a widely respected historical figure in Asia. “I believe we should also plant more trees along the streets today. I once suggested in a conversation with a friend that we plant cherry trees in front of all of the train stations throughout Japan. This has been my dream since I was a youth. “There is also a famous passage in the Lotus Sutra that says: ‘Jeweled trees abound in flowers and fruit / where living beings enjoy themselves at ease’ (The Lotus Sutra, 230). Your activities are wondrously in tune with the spirit of the Lotus Sutra. Shakyamuni compared a genuinely happy state of existence to a place of bounteous flowers and fruits hanging from jeweled trees, where living beings can rest and enjoy life.” Both President Ikeda and the SGI have been firm supporters of environmental causes, including the Earth Charter, which was officially launched in The Hague in 2000. At the request of Steven Rockefeller, chair of the Earth Charter Drafting Committee, Mr. Ikeda contributed comments to the draft. In addition, the SGI has provided unstinting support and cooperation for the film A Quiet Revolution, produced by the Earth Council. Furthermore, an exhibition titled Seeds of Change: The Earth Charter and Human Potential, jointly produced by the SGI and the Earth Charter Initiative, has been presented in fifteen countries and regions. Through the film, exhibition, and other activities, the SGI has helped make Dr. Maathai’s Green Belt Movement widely known throughout the world. A Canadian NGO has employed information presented in the film and exhibition to produce French and English booklets that have been distributed to junior high and high school students. The Soka Gakkai in Japan is presently working on a new exhibition on the theme of the Earth Charter to support the United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development, which begins this year. Mr. Ikeda: “During a speech you gave at Nairobi University last year, you said: ‘Don’t sit back and complain. Who are you waiting for to take action? You must take action.’ I am convinced that we must communicate the appeal you made on that occasion to people all around the world. “In that regard, what do you think we should do to help solve the environmental crisis? What, in your opinion, is the most basic step that we, as individuals and groups, can take?” Dr. Maathai: “Earlier you introduced my comment that serving others is life’s greatest happiness. All great teachers have spent their lives focused not on themselves but on others. I believe that serving, giving of yourself, is a very satisfying experience. “Especially when you have been endowed with innate gifts, it’s important to share those gifts—just like a tree, which shares the fruit it produces. It’s good to share and to volunteer to serve others. “Young people, too, need to learn that there is satisfaction in service—that sometimes the dissatisfaction they feel comes from focusing too much on themselves.” Mr. Ikeda: “That’s a very important insight. Your study of biology has been a real plus in your environmental protection activities, hasn’t it?” Dr. Maathai: “Yes. As a biologist, I was privileged to learn the way nature operates. Science encourages us to develop critical thinking and ask questions—‘Why does that happen?’ and ‘How does this work?’” Dr. Maathai: “The first UN Conference on Women was held in Mexico in 1975. In preparation, I researched the needs of Kenyan women, and I learned that what they wanted most was clean water to drink, cooking fuel—mostly from wood—and food from the land. These issues, I realized, were all intimately connected to the land. It became clear to me that many of the problems communities were facing were the result of environmental degradation. “I could then slowly mobilize people to change their own environment by doing things for themselves rather than waiting for the government or community leaders. “I also realized that quite often there is a lack of understanding of the links between environmental degradation and the needs of society; so I started an education program to help people acquire that understanding. As more and more people understood the connections, they became willing to join me and participate in our movement.” Mr. Ikeda: “I see. And the result was a large number of women working together, creating an astonishing new force for positive action.” Dr. Maathai articulated her interest in establishing a learning center that would allow people to study environmental problems in a systematic fashion. She also said that she herself could learn much from the SGI leader’s establishment of the Soka schools and universities as a means to promote learning and Soka values. Voicing his hearty approval of Dr. Maathai’s plan, Mr. Ikeda stressed that education is the fundamental way to solving the problems humanity faces. For that precise reason, he added, he had chosen education as his life’s final challenge and was devoting all his energies to it. The two leaders expressed the hope that they could meet again and talk further about their shared concerns. Mr. Ikeda presented his guest with a collection of his photographs. Looking at the images, Dr. Maathai exclaimed at their beauty, adding that she liked the photograph of a road leading into the distance from the grounds of Windsor Castle best of all. Smiling, she said it reminded her of the road to supreme happiness. She then presented Mr. Ikeda with a handwritten card with the words: “Dr. Daisaku Ikeda: Thank you for your great work and commitment. [The documentary] A Quiet Revolution has been a great source of inspiration to us and to many visitors we have shared it with. Thank you!” Ambassador Awori also expressed his appreciation for the contributions of President Ikeda and SGI members to Kenyan society and in particular for the educational exchange programs Soka University is undertaking with the University of Nairobi. As Dr. Maathai left the building, young people waving Kenyan flags gave the tireless crusader for the environment, women’s rights, and peace a rousing send-off. Bidding his guest farewell, President Ikeda said he would never forget their encounter, and that he looked forward to meeting her again. He also offered his best wishes for her continued success.

Habuki, Inaugural President of Soka University, Announces Retirement", "text": "Dear Members of the SUA Community, Dr. Daniel Y. Habuki has informed me that he will be retiring this summer due to health reasons, after completing his 27th year of service as the inaugural President of Soka University of America. President Habuki will continue in his role until the next president is appointed. On behalf of the Board of Trustees, I would like to express our deepest appreciation to Danny for his years of dedication, sacrifice and service toward the growth and development of our university. Under his unprecedented leadership, SUA has grown tremendously and flourished, from a small graduate program in the 1990s to one of the top 30 liberal arts colleges in the country. With his focus on academic excellence and care for each student’s development and happiness, Danny insured that every student received the best education possible, as he encouraged a culture of care across the campus. With many of our SUA graduates being accepted into the top graduate schools and programs throughout the country and the world and advancing in their careers and professions, it is clear that his approach fostered the right environment for their growth and success. Danny established the Soka Opportunity Scholarship program to make Soka education available to students of limited means around the world. Through his tireless philanthropic efforts, Danny greatly expanded the university’s fiscal and campus foundation. SUA’s endowment has grown fivefold since its inception. The original campus was built and has been further transformed with construction of a world class performing arts center, academic building, additional residence halls, and now the completion of a new state-of-the-art life science building—the Marie and Pierre Curie Hall. Danny shared that “none of this would have been possible without the tremendous vision, founding principles and support by our university founder, Dr. Daisaku Ikeda, to whom I have dedicated my life’s work. I am deeply humbled and filled with appreciation to have had this opportunity to serve and to be surrounded by such dedicated staff, faculty and students.

Habuki", "text": "Dear SUA community, Across the nation and the world, we’ve witnessed the outrage sparked by the recent killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd resulting from systemic racism in our society. For far too long, the indifference to, and the dehumanization of, the black community has caused unending suffering. We must not ignore human suffering, the pain of others. Our core values as an institution necessitate that we care deeply and seek to be the change we want to see in our world. I cannot begin to fathom the pain and suffering of the families who have lost their loved ones. My heart is with them, our community and family, who are hurting and living with this fear daily, which is further heightened by a pandemic that continues to have a disproportionate impact on communities of color. At this most challenging time, I reflect on a racist exchange Mr. Ikeda witnessed between a young African American boy and an older white man in 1960 during his visit to Chicago, Illinois. The older man’s mistreatment of this young boy filled Mr. Ikeda with a deep sense of indignation. Addressing the young boy in his heart, he vowed to build a society truly worthy of the young boy’s love and pride. It is with this spirit that Mr. Ikeda founded Soka University of America based on the principles of peace, human rights, and the sanctity of life. He has made it his lifelong goal to focus on education as the key to enduring social change and global peace. Based on the efforts of our current students to address racism, diversity, equity, and inclusion on campus, we began to seriously tackle these issues within our own community. Although we recognize there is much more work to be done, we are committed to ensuring that our university lives up to its founding principles and mission. It is my hope we can come together as a community to build a school and society that is truly worthy of your love and pride. In closing, I would like to share Mr. Ikeda’s recent words from his message to the graduates of the Class of 2020: “You are all pioneers striving to ensure the survival of humanity, ushering in a sublime future in which all may coexist in harmony. Having studied here at this university, which abounds with the profound yearning for peace held by individuals from every corner of the globe, you are the vanguard in leading lives to advance the wellbeing and welfare of ordinary people.” Please stay safe and healthy.

This decision was not an easy one and after many meetings the Undergraduate Academic Continuity Community and the In-Person Education Committee were unanimous in coming to this decision. I have confirmed that the Graduate School and Bridge Program have also made the same decision. The many challenges of being able to meet whatever requirements the state or local officials will eventually outline made it clear that out of an abundance of caution and safety for our entire community, this was the right decision. On May 15, the Department of Education provided updated guidance for interruptions related to COVID-19 extending the distance education waiver through the end of the calendar year/end of the Fall semester. This allows us to make this decision. We have also decided that we will not offer on campus housing this Fall. Hyon Moon, our Dean of Students, will be sending a separate announcement regarding the housing decision and some of the factors affecting it, which were also important in our decision to continue remote education in the Fall. This decision to continue with remote education in the Fall was reported to the Board of Trustees at their meeting which just occurred between May 19-21. In light of the economic impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on students and their families, the Board of Trustees has taken the following actions to help and support our students: The Office of Financial Aid will be sending emails with more information on both of these decisions in the near future. While the university faces economic challenges due to the pandemic, we recognize that students and their families are facing the same challenges. We hope these actions will help to alleviate some of the financial hardships so that our students can continue their education and development as future global citizens.

The Luis and Linda Nieves Observatory gives Soka students—and astronomers around the world—access to powerful tools to study the cosmos. The observatory , made possible by a gift from the Luis and Linda Nieves Family Foundation, features an advanced research-grade telescope that allows for the viewing of galaxies, nebulae, and other celestial bodies with precision. Observatory Systems of Pasadena, California, designed the observatory system using the latest telescope mount technology from PlaneWave Instruments of Compton, California. The remote operating system can be used by researchers and students from anywhere in the world. Bryan Penprase, dean of faculty and professor of astronomy, is a member of the Caltech-led group GROWTH (Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen), and looks forward to using the Nieves Observatory to connect Soka students with the group’s resources and expertise. GROWTH’s network includes telescopes in the United States, India, Sweden, Taiwan, Japan, Israel, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Australia. “The sources that are discovered here in California can then be tracked by other telescopes around the world after sunrise in California,” Penprase said. “It allows a global community of astronomers to work together, and since here at Soka we’re so interested in global citizenship, I recognize that group to be an especially rich environment for our students to begin collaborating with astronomers from around the world.” Soka students Taiga Morioka ’21 and Jett Facey ’21, who helped Penprase and Observatory Systems install the observatory, are co-authors with Penprase on a paper concerning a transient nova that is nearing publication in the Astrophysics Journal . The “Sky Pavilion,” Penprase’s nickname for the observatory and its foundational platform, is located by the basketball courts on the western edge of the Soka campus, adjacent to the expansive green space of Aliso and Wood Canyons Wilderness Park. The setting, which provides clear viewing conditions shielded from Orange County’s urban light centers, has also upgraded the experience for Soka astronomy classes. And the remote control features were especially handy after students were forced to leave campus in March because of the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, Rodas Bekele ’21, a third-year student from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, was able to operate the telescope from Raleigh, North Carolina, where she is staying with her uncle’s family. One of Bekele’s projects in “Astronomy 120: Earth’s Cosmic Context—The Discovery of Other Earths and the Origins of the Universe” was to capture an image of M81, a galaxy about 12 million light years from earth. So on several nights after the sunset in Aliso Viejo—later in the evening in North Carolina-—Bekele connected to the Nieves Observatory via the internet, set the coordinates for the galaxy and opened the camera’s aperture for several minutes. Her first results underwhelmed her. “Honestly, when I started the class,” said Bekele, “I imagined when I looked through the telescope it would be like the pictures we see online, like the really colorful pretty galaxies, but it was literally like a dot.” After experimenting with longer exposures and then running the results through computer software to adjust the color mix, Bekele, whose Soka concentration is Environmental Studies, produced a final image that Professor Penprase said, “shows wonderful detail in the spiral arms of M81 and reveals the structure of a beautiful face-on galaxy.” Another class project singled out by Penprase was by Daniel Navarrete-Toulet ’21, who blended blue, green, and red images of the M51 galaxy to show its “true color.” Navarrete-Toulet, a third-year Social and Behavioral Sciences student from San Diego, said he was immediately transfixed by the project, staying up to nearly dawn working on the image. M51, a spiral galaxy 23 million light years from Earth, is in optimal position for viewing from Aliso Viejo in the 3 a.m. hour. Navarrete-Toulet focused on the galaxy and set the camera to capture light for 10 minutes for each of the colors. He then spent another 45 minutes adjusting the mix until he had it right. “You don’t know what they’ll look like put together,” Navarrete-Toulet said, “but after that you get this magnificent little thing.” The astronomy class was one of Navarrete-Toulet’s favorites this semester; so much so that he got permission from Penprase to use the telescope during his free time. And during Soka’s spring semester finals week last month, Navarrete-Toulet was connecting to the telescope late at night to work on his final project, studying evidence of planets in other solar systems by observing dips in the brightness of stars. It’s a relatively new method of study, and Navarrete-Toulet said he feels fortunate to have the opportunity at Soka. “It’s really quite marvelous,” he said, “that something that we wouldn’t have been able to do 20 years ago anywhere, we’re doing today in an undergraduate setting.” View more images at the Nieves Observatory website .", "categories": ["Undergraduate Academics", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "June 08, 2020", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

The program was initiated by Bryan Penprase, dean of faculty, who appointed SUA anthropology professor Sarah England as the inaugural Fulbright advisor, with the support from SUA VPAA Edward Feasel. Professor England in her first year as Fulbright advisor was able to advise eight SUA students who completed applications for Fulbright fellowships in six different countries (Spain, Colombia, Indonesia, France, South Korea, and Portugal). Of these eight students who applied, six reached semi-finalist status, where the Fulbright commission recommends them to the host country. Of those six finalists, two were granted Fulbright Fellowships. The two SUA Fulbright recipients for 2019 are Sofia Dugas, who will be an English teaching assistant in Medellin, Columbia, and Miranda Almeida, who will be an English teaching assistant in Spain. The other applicants include Jessica Lee, Celeste Marquez, Suzanna Stockey, Zoe Frye, Michael Note, and Khyla Horton. The Fulbright US Student Program is designed specifically for US citizen students with a degree from a US university to study, research, engage in an artistic activity, and teach English abroad. Grants are for one year and follow the US academic calendar. The program includes fellowships for research in one of 140 participating countries, or fellowships enabling students to serve as a teaching assistant in one of 75 participating countries. Fulbright awardees are also expected to carry out some form of community engagement project in addition to their research or teaching. Soka University of America, with its commitment to developing global citizens, is an ideal training ground for students interested in Fulbright and other international fellowships. After the success of the inaugural year of SUA’s Fulbright Advising program, new workshops are being planned for students to apply next year. In the next round, we are hopeful to have even more applicants, and we will also help advise our domestic and international students interested in fellowships through the Princeton in Asia/Africa/Latin America programs, which offer a similar opportunity to work abroad to help NGOs and educators in a wide variety of countries.

A review of this innovative work written by the late Professor Anthony C.

Its wide-ranging and lucid discussions cover a huge terrain, from ancient metaphysics to quantum mechanics. The enlistment of certain classical Confucian concepts and themes at critical junctures to advance the book’s argument also provides a luminous comparison. His interpretation of the Confucian emphasis on life as social and self-preservation is both humane and interesting, much as his analysis of the Mencian notion of compassion deserves our attention.” Tetsushi Ogata, Visiting Assistant Professor of Peace and Conflict Studies Professor Tetsushi Ogata was invited by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Armenia to attend the Third Global Forum Against the Crime of Genocide from December 9–11, 2018, in Yerevan, Armenia.

The preliminary cross-linguistic investigation into the common conceptual sources of personal pronouns suggests similar results. While his book is clearly designed for a specialist readership, Professor Ishiyama’s extensive use of PowerPoint illustrations ensured that his presentation was accessible to both specialist and non-specialist alike.

About Jazzy Ash Jazzy Ash, also known as Ashli Christoval, grew up with her mother from New Orleans and her father from Trinidad. Music infused her home life every day, from jazz to Caribbean rhythms to the lively children’s music which was playing all the time for the kids in her mother’s home day care. She often spent summers in New Orleans with her aunts and grandparents, enjoying the culture and music that permeated their West Bank neighborhood. Later on, after becoming mom to two sons, she earned a degree in early childhood development and embarked on her music education program, Leaping Lizards Music. Jazzy Ash’s NOLA visits, especially during Mardi Gras, reaffirmed the importance of exploring this part of her heritage. “Learning about this music and performing it gives me a foundation. Truly, I’ve found myself through this experience. Even though I was born in California, I see myself as a second-generation New Orleanian, since New Orleans is so much a part of my family’s experience, going back at least seven generations.” Ash and her band, Jazzy Ash and the Leaping Lizards, have had the pleasure of performing at Lincoln Center and Symphony Space in New York, Getty Center in California, and World Cafe Live in Philadelphia, Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts, and Ann Arbor Summer Festival, among other prestigious venues. Additionally, Jazzy Ash continues to focus on education, regularly teaching performing arts to children and music education to educators. Most recently, Jazzy Ash has hosted workshops for National HeadStart, NAEYC, and MaxFunCon. Her music has been featured in the Los Angeles Times and NPR, and continues to top the Children’s Music Charts.

{"newspaper": "soka-news", "url": "https://www.soka.edu/news-events/news/toni-morrisons-beloved-and-language-american-fiction", "title": "Toni Morrison's Beloved and the Language of American Fiction", "text": "The internationally reputed American literary scholar Jonathan Arac gave Soka students and professors an insightful look into the tragic world of Toni Morrison’s classic novel Beloved . Arac explored millennia of literature in his lecture, citing works from Aristotle to Jane Austen to demonstrate the novel’s universal and timeless themes. Arac began his lecture with an exposition on the history of slavery in the U.S. and explained slavery’s changing representation in literature: “prior to 1950, [the] history of slavery was written from the point of the slaveholder.” He then cited Auerbach’s Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature as an indicator of the change, which reads “great literature may be made from the experiences of everyday life.” Arac explained that this pithy realization showed how later writers would “[take] artistic authority out of the hands of the institution and into the hands of the enslaved,” and that this new direction- “finding the right language”- would allow people to produce “new and true perceptions.” Arac’s investigation into Toni Morrison uncovered her “affinity for Greek tragedy,” an art form he defined as “unspeakable things being spoken.” According to Arac, Morrison used the tried and true power of Greek tragedy to tell her story because of its “contradiction of pity (it can happen to me) and terror (how can it be)?” However, Arac made it clear that despite Greek tragedy’s impression on Morrison, she was not writing a tragedy but a novel. Received with some protest from Soka’s humanities professors, Arac used Georg Lukács’ definition of the novel as “an epic of a world abandoned by God.” Arac’s concluded his lecture with a nod to Walter Benjamin’s concept of “civilization & barbarism,” a direction that incited a respectful albeit heated discussion among the humanities professors Jim Merod and Oleg Gelikman. Students sat in awe as the unique minds of Arac, Merod, and Gelikman contested and refined theories in a candid conversation that continued for hours after the event. When asked what one should take away from his lecture, Arac replied: “…the thought that it’s possible that out of the greatest historical pain to make something beautiful & powerful.” —Riley Murphy ‘20", "categories": ["Humanities"], "date_publish": "March 02, 2020", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

A Vertiginous Trip through Hitchcock and Hollywood", "text": "Oleg Gelikman, professor and director of the Humanities concentration, introduced visiting professor O. Bradley Bassler’s lecture on Hitchcock’s Vertigo with intrigue, referring to the classic as “something that is clearly not a film.” Many students—both from and outside of John Kehlen and Jim Merod’s Film History and Cinematic Technique course—attended the event and came away with a deeper appreciation for Hitchcock and his methods. O. Bradley Bassler, associate professor of philosophy and its relation to literature, mathematics, and physics at the University of Georgia, called Vertigo “a movie which one has to see and engage over a long period of time.” He marveled at “the extent to which Vertigo continues to open itself up” and how it addresses “the way our experiences drift off into the past and rise up from the past.” Bassler used Vertigo and Dave Thomson’s The Whole Equation: A History of Hollywood to answer three essential questions of cinema: What makes a movie? What makes a good movie? What does a movie do to us? Bassler claimed that a successful film must be entertaining and have aesthetic effect; if it’s entertaining but lacks aesthetic effect it’s a cheap thrill, and if it has aesthetic effect but doesn’t entertain it’s an arthouse film. With its gripping plot twist and enrapturing visual metaphors, Vertigo satisfies the whole equation. Bassler explained that Hitchcock pioneered the art of storyboarding and “mapped out movies in such detail that he could direct the film over the phone.” Hitchcock’s methodical and intentional directing allowed Vertigo to explore metaphysical themes like the uneasy differentiation of dreams and reality. Bassler evinced Vertigo’s subtle genius by playing a scene that begins with Johnny (the main character) waking up, and then asked the audience “was the preceding scene just a dream?” When asked what to look for in a film as markers of quality and timelessness, Bassler responded “There are certain movies, and often it will be the case that you can’t consciously see why this happens, that manage to capture the spirit of something. You can feel it, and you can tell because you almost feel like you’re there. You’re a part of it. What is required is a certain kind of identification with the movie, and yet, of course, that identification shouldn’t be something in which you totally lose yourself. It requires this complicated condition in which you continue to recognize at some level, even at just the back of your head, that you’re watching a movie and that you’ve become absorbed in your watching.” Bassler, like Hitchcock, gave the audience a thrilling vertigo with his professional and creative exploration of our storied relationship with cinema. —Riley Murphy ‘20", "categories": ["Humanities"], "date_publish": "March 11, 2020", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Grammy Award-nominated Rocky Dawuni is a galvanizing performer, musician and activist who straddles the boundaries between Africa, the Caribbean and the US to create his unique “Afrobeat” sound that unites generations and cultures. His music is a progressive fusion of Reggae, Afrobeat, soul and Highlife music, and influenced by the soulful beats of Fela Kuti, the positive messages of Bob Marley and the infectious, sing-along anthems of Michael Franti and K’naan.  Rocky has shared the stage with Stevie Wonder, Peter Gabriel, Bono, Jason Mraz, Janelle Monae and John Legend, among many others, and was named one of Africa’s Top 10 global stars by CNN. Tickets are $25. They are available for purchase online , at the Box Office at 1 University Drive in Aliso Viejo, or by calling 949. 490.4278. About Rocky Dawuni Rocky Dawuni began his life as the child of a cook on a military barracks in Ghana. His father’s innate intelligence and charm helped him quickly rise in his position to become the cook for the base’s colonels and generals. During this time, his father, Koyatu Dawuni, befriended many high-ranking officers and observed the deep pride they felt in sending their children to school. Dawuni’s father began to raise his own children with the same standards, investing heavily in education. The second born of eight siblings, Dawuni excelled at school and eventually his father decided to move him back to their home village where he could learn more about his cultural heritage. As it turned out, Koyatu’s humble employment belied his status as a member of the royal family of the Konkomba tribe, which ruled from a village called Bunbon Nayili in Northern Ghana. After retiring from the military, Koyatu returned to his native village to serve as the Chief, a role currently held by Dawuni’s older brother, Chief Wumbe Dawuni. Despite the isolation of the village and barracks life, Dawuni was exposed to the music of other cultures after his father was posted to Egypt with the United Nations forces. The multi-ethnic mix of Ghanaian tribes in the barracks also revealed to Dawuni the diversity of expressions found in his own country. “I was always looking for music,” Dawuni remembers, “Whenever bands played, I would gravitate towards that. There was a band in the barracks called Hot Barrels, and I remember that every time they had rehearsal I would chill at their space and just listen to them play.” Throughout Dawuni’s childhood music was always at the forefront of his passions. Dawuni’s youth coincided with an era of political turmoil and frequent military coups in Ghana, and music provided the soundtrack for this tumultuous era. After moving to the capital city Accra to pursue a degree in philosophy and psychology at the University of Ghana, Rocky’s spent hours mining his friend’s record collections, discovering the Afrobeat of Fela Kuti from Nigeria, the African soul of Osibisa, as well as highlife groups such as the African Brothers, not to mention Jamaican reggae and American funk and soul. Through these inspirations and his own experiences, he began to gravitate towards any music that articulated a message of unity and hope. While at University he formed his first band, Local Crisis, with a group of friends. They had no real instruments except an acoustic guitar played by the bassist. The drummer created a kit out of cardboard and the keyboardist used a toy keyboard. Dawuni sang and performed his own original songs. They made their first demo by simply singing directly into a tape recorder. “It was the most-low tech thing you can imagine,” recalls Dawuni, “but there was just the fire and determination and we believed in what we were doing.” Despite the lack of instruments and professional recording equipment, their music gained immediate success on campus. They decided to try to perform at a large Pan African event taking place in Accra, but with no prior knowledge about how to book concerts, the band just showed up at the promoter’s office on the day of the event. The promoter, intrigued by this group of passionate yet clearly inexperienced student musicians, decided to let them play once the main concert was over. As spectators started filing out of the venue, Local Crisis picked up the instruments on stage, unsure of how to use such advanced equipment, and began to play their music with heart and soul. The audience eagerly returned back to the stage, the band was a hit, and Dawuni’s musical career took off. In 1996 he produced his first album, The Movement, backed by members of Local Crisis and other Ghanaian reggae stars. The Movement became a major success in Ghana with a number of hit singles including “What Goes Around” and “Sugar.” However, Dawuni continued to believe that his music could serve as a bridge between Africa and the rest of the world. His first international exposure came through the 1998 Putumayo collection Reggae Around the World, which featured his song “In Ghana,” alongside tracks by Lucky Dube, Burning Spear, Ernest Ranglin and others. In 2010, Dawuni contributed a cover of Bob Marley’s “Sun Is Shining” to the Putumayo album Tribute to a Reggae Legend. In 1998, Dawuni released his second album Crusade, followed by Awakening in 2001, Book of Changes in 2005 and Hymns for the Rebel Soul in 2010. Each album brought him greater acclaim and wider recognition both in Ghana and abroad. Today, Dawuni is a household name in his native land, and widely considered one of Africa’s most recognized international stars. Dawuni’s music has been featured in numerous television programs, including ER, Weeds and Dexter. In 2010, Dawuni’s song “African Soccer Fever” was included on the FIFA World Cup South Africa video game from EA Sports, one of many times Dawuni’s songs have been included in EA video games. Dawuni’s cover of John Lennon’s “Well Well Well” appeared on the digital bonus version of the Amnesty International benefit album Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur which was released by Warner Brothers in 2007 and featured appearances by U2, R.E.M., Aerosmith featuring Sierra Leone’s Refugee All Stars, Black Eyed Peas and others. Dawuni has also participated in the 2009 Playing for Change album, singing along with Bono on “War/No More Trouble” and Keb Mo’ on “Biko.” In 2003, Dawuni teamed up with KCRW DJ Jeremy Sole to create Afro Funke’, a regular musical event in Los Angeles dedicated to African music, culture and art and its far-reaching legacy around the world. Afro Funke’ presents international guest DJs, live performances, guest musicians, dancers, cutting-edge films, record release parties, fundraisers, fashion shows, art installations, crafts and more. It has built a dedicated following, attracting celebrities such as Prince, India.Arie, Queen Latifah and Stevie Wonder. Rocky’s performances include appearing in front of 18,000 people in Toronto, Canada alongside Somalian superstar K’naan and at the Freedom Awards in Los Angeles with pop sensation Jason Mraz. In July 2011, he performed at the Hollywood Bowl with the legendary Stevie Wonder during a night of “Global Soul,” and appeared at France’s Les Estivales de la Perriere in August of the same year with Shaggy, Monty Alexander and Diana King where they joined together on a magical rendition of Bob Marley’s “No Woman, No Cry.” In March 2012, Rocky headlined the BaliSpirit Festival in Bali, Indonesia for the second time in three years and received a glowing feature in Rolling Stone Indonesia. In July 2013, Rocky appeared at Switzerland’s renowned Montreux Jazz Festival. Rocky continues to tour the world and has increasingly been performing extensively in India, Africa, Europe, Australia and beyond as both a celebrated musician and activist. Dawuni’s eloquence, cultural diplomacy and successful melding of music and activism have led him to become a passionate spokesperson for various global causes. He has joined forces with Product (RED), UNICEF, the Carter Center, and the UN Foundation. He has worked on campaigns focused on Guinea worm eradication, environmental issues, women’s health and education, HIV Aids advocacy, peace building and clean water. In 2012, Dawuni was appointed the Tourism and Cultural Ambassador of Ghana and World Ambassador for the Musicians Union of Ghana. The same year, he was named a United Nations Foundation Ambassador for the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves, an initiative launched by Hillary Clinton, alongside actress Julia Roberts and chef José Andrés. In 2013, Rocky performed at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (UNFCC) in Warsaw, Poland in front of the United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki Moon and delegates from around the world. He also has served on a Brookings Institute think tank on cultural diplomacy (Timbuktu Action Group) as part of the efforts to restore Mali’s famed Festival Au Desert and was invited by Aegis Trust and the Kigali Genocide Memorial Center to Rwanda to meet the Minister of Youth and Culture and visit the Gihembe refugee camp in order to highlight Rwanda’s shinning efforts to heal the wounds of the past. Rocky was designated a UN Goodwill Ambassador for Africa at a beautiful concert and designation event at the UN Headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya in August 2018 held during the Global Landscapes Forum with dignitaries from all over the world. Dawuni’s sixth album, Branches of the Same Tree , was released worldwide on March 31, 2015 by the Cumbancha record label and was subsequently nominated for a Grammy Award for “Best Reggae Album” at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards 2016. Branches continues to bring him an even wider international audience. Reflecting his maturity as an artist, the album highlights Dawuni’s ability to communicate a universal, uplifting message that crosses borders and reaches out to the hearts of millions. Branches features the Afro Dancehall mashup “African Thriller” and its striking accompanying video as well as “Shine A Light” which is a welcome bit of joy in these troubled times. On January 25, 2019, Rocky released the first single and title track to his much anticipated 7th studio album entitled Beats of Zion with its striking accompanying video shot in Jamestown, Accra (Ghana). The full album dropped on March 8, 2019 through Six Degrees Distribution with the release of the second video from the album “Wickedest Sound” which features Ghanaian dancehall star Stonebwoy. “Beats of Zion” has been receiving rave reviews from Afropop Worldwide, World Music Central, Medium.com and PopMatters. The track “Burn One” from the new album was named “Top Tune of the Day” on tastemaker station KCRW and appeared on TNT’s hit TV drama “Animal Kingdom.” Another track from the album “Let’s Go” is the theme song for Cadbury Canada’s Bicycle Factory Campaign 2018 and the beautiful 360-degree video from the song has already reached over 1 million views on You Tube.

Because there were only two of us on the panel both the chair and the discussant read our papers and gave us feedback. I received very positive feedback from both of them and they asked me questions that made me want to continue my research after Soka. The discussant on my panel said that my capstone felt like the beginning of a PhD dissertation and she hoped that I would continue my research. Before WPSA I had no intention of continuing my research and now I would like to. A week or so after the panel the journal of International Relations and Diplomacy (ISSN2328-2134, doi:  10.17265/2328-2134/) emailed me expressing interest in publishing my paper. That was another great ego boost. Thank you so much for working with Peter Burns to create this opportunity for us, it has had an extremely positive impact on my development as a scholar. Sofia Torres, Class of 2019 (pictured back row, right) The WPSA conference was the first conference I have attended as an undergraduate student. I attended four panels and was refreshed by the research that others presented. It was a very informative experience to hear about topics of study that are not typical to the SUA community such as the politics of female leaders and the influence of media on education. During the poster session, I learned from other students and received feedback and questions about my research. Overall, I had a great experience and hope that this opportunity is given to more SUA students in the future.", "categories": ["Academics", "Undergraduate Academics", "Social and Behavioral Sciences"], "date_publish": "April 18, 2019", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Guthrie will be joined by special guest Folk Uke. If hindsight is 20/20 vision, Arlo Guthrie has a vast perspective looking forward. After decades of Arlo perpetually touring, the folksinger is dialing it back a bit, but the road has become a way of life for Arlo: sharing songs and stories, getting to the heart of what really matters, and of course, being a comedic agitator. It’s in his blood. It’s who he is. It’s what he does. Stirring the pot, questioning the powers that be, and reminding us what it’s all about with humor and passion. Initially making a name for himself in the sixties with the iconic “Alice’s Restaurant Massacree” and providing perhaps the most often repeated phrase from Woodstock (“The New York State Thruway is closed, man.”), Guthrie helped define the singer-songwriter genre burgeoning in the seventies. With over thirty albums in his discography, an Arlo Guthrie show delivers an astounding time capsule from the works of his dad, Woody Guthrie, to the present day. Arlo’s 20/20 Tour will continue to feature the crowd favorite “Alice’s Restaurant Massacree.” Accompanying him will be longtime bandmates Abe Guthrie and drummer Terry “A La Berry” Hall. Joining Arlo Guthrie throughout the show will be special guest Folk Uke, the enchantingly harmonizing, irreverent and indecorously humored duo of Cathy Guthrie and Amy Nelson. Folk Uke has three albums to date and their music has been featured in Orange Is The New Black and Super Troopers 2. An evening with Arlo Guthrie will be what it’s always been — inspirational, uplifting, intimate, humorous, and affecting.

We walked through the poster presentations happening at the time, asking questions and listening to the researchers’ descriptions of their projects. We then attended a talk about teaching the “iGeneration” (generation Z), and another talk about the investment model theory of relationships. The first topic was clearly well-researched but a bit under-stimulating and quite long, whereas the second one was much more interesting (perhaps because I had recently been learning about that theory in one of my classes). After the talks, I had the chance to present my own poster. I was a bit nervous, but overall felt respected by those who stopped by to ask questions; I was proud that I got to talk in detail about my capstone work, and excited that I was finally surrounded by people who are also obsessed with psychology. Overall, I most enjoyed being able to talk one-on-one with those presenting their posters. I felt that this give-and-take portion of the conference allowed me to better synthesize what I was interested in regarding psychology, as well as discover new areas of discipline and come up with some interesting questions. I also believe that, with the chance to present my own work, I found myself both becoming more confident in my abilities as a researcher and coming up with new questions to further the research I had done. Shania Davis, Class of 2018 (pictured in center) I found this year’s Western Psychological Association conference to be very enlightening. It was the first time I had a chance to participate in an event such as this, and I truly enjoyed feeling a small part of an incredibly big profession. Prior to my attendance, I had absolutely no idea what to expect. A fellow colleague and I talked about how nervous we were to present our studies in front of a group who were so knowledgeable about the process. We felt inadequate, as if we might not fit in or belong. However, once I walked through those doors, all of those feeling disappeared; I was among my peers. It was only when those feelings disappeared that I was able to truly enjoy myself. I heard so many unique student presentations, the most memorable being a three-part study on “catfishing.” I sat in on an incredible talk about teaching the “iGen” generation, received some shockingly devastating trends  on the effects of smartphones and was presented with teaching solutions as to how to accommodate this upcoming generation. Finally, when I gave my presentation the following day, I was surprised to see how many people were generally interested in my research; more importantly, I was surprised about how comfortable I was speaking with them. I found those conversations to be the most memorable—not only did those conversations provide ways for me to expand this research in the future, but validated the importance of my research and its large impact on my community. The students who came and spoke to me were all part of my generation; they have all experienced this phenomenon and felt that it was a topic of vital importance. As a result, I feel more confident than ever that this is the profession to which I truly belong.", "categories": ["Academics", "Undergraduate Academics", "Social and Behavioral Sciences"], "date_publish": "April 25, 2019", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

The presenters were typically PhD students seeking feedback on their dissertations or professors sharing their research. After a few panel sessions, I realized I kept going back to the same conference rooms, which to me meant that certain topics (public policy, electoral politics, and political psychology) definitely spoke out to me more than others. I was excited to come to this realization as I now feel more confident in the areas of study I want to pursue in my master’s degree. At the panels, I noticed that there was a sequential order in which research is typically conducted (research question -> past literature -> theory -> hypotheses -> dependent/independent variables by hypothesis -> methods -> results -> implications). I mostly knew this, but the part about having specific theories to base your hypotheses was really reinforced for me. For example, one paper presentation explored the differences between parties via presidential candidates’ speeches during primary debates to see if their diction utilized more care vs. harm words, an emphasis on fairness vs. cheating, ingroup vs. betrayal frames, etc. based on the moral foundations theory. I had no idea that this framework existed and I found the thought of doing a content analysis with a “moral foundations dictionary” new and exciting. At first, I was a bit intimidated by the size of the conference, even more so because I was the only person from SUA in attendance. However, because I did not know anyone I was forced to step out of my comfort zone and engage in meaningful interactions with other students and professors. By speaking with academics, I could better figure out how to pursue the paths I am interested in within political science (which are currently public policy and political psychology). I also got great advice about which graduate schools best suit my interests, as well as some tips on how to best prepare for applications to those schools. I have no doubt that when I look back on this conference in the future, I will see that the opportunity of presenting my own research on a panel as only a third-year undergraduate student served as a life-changing event in terms of my academic trajectory. I have been working on this project since May 2018 and to be able to share it with others was quite a meaningful experience. I was able to receive great feedback that will help me with my research in the future, starting with my capstone. I look forward to picking a topic for my thesis, conducting research, and doing more intricate statistical analyses in order to dig deep and produce some interesting findings. I am greatly appreciative of the SBS concentration for supporting me in my academic endeavors and encouraging me to attend and present at this conference. It was an experience I will never forget and I look forward to continuing my studies in the social sciences field.", "categories": ["Academics", "Undergraduate Academics", "Social and Behavioral Sciences"], "date_publish": "January 17, 2019", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

The program builds upon an earlier program known as the Course Relief program, developed by Ed Feasel and Michael Weiner, which awarded points to faculty based on their publications in research journals and in books. The new program, codeveloped by Dean of Faculty Bryan Penprase, VPAA Ed Feasel, and Associate Dean Michael Weiner, includes an analysis of submitted faculty publications that recognizes faculty publications within the top-tier academic presses and journals, as well as high profile activities within scholarly disciplines. These additional components include chairing and organizing conferences, publishing and editing academic journals and representing SUA at a wide variety of academic settings and performance venues. Faculty submit their works in a bi-annual cycle, the first of which occurred in September 2019. Dean Bryan Penprase and Associate Dean Michael Weiner developed criteria for prioritizing the highest impact journals and most prestigious academic presses using a wide variety of internationally recognized measures. The effort has been developed to identify and recognize those scholars within SUA’s faculty who are having great impacts across the world in their research and scholarship, which greatly benefits SUA students by enabling faculty to bring deeper and fresher insights into their subjects in the classroom and in capstone projects. The research also enhances the reputation and prestige of SUA, and we are grateful to all of SUA’s faculty for their hard work in all of their diverse scholarly activities. Our first 11 SUA faculty selected for a Merit Award are listed below, and we congratulate them for their achievements which represent an amazing range and depth of intellectual interests. SUA 2019 Merit Award Winners: The Merit Award winners were recognized in an Awards Banquet at the Athenaeum on April 25. The event was opened by Dean of Faculty Bryan Penprase, who introduced VPAA Ed Feasel, who provided opening words that described the history of faculty research at SUA, and an overview of program and congratulations to the faculty winners. Danny Habuki provided an inspirational speech to the gathered faculty and presented the Merit Awards to the faculty. Arch Asawa, SUA’s CFO, was also in attendance and has provided crucial support to the new program.  The Merit Award program will continue with a biannual submission schedule, and faculty will be invited to submit their materials for consideration for the next round during Fall Semester 2020 for awards in Spring 2021.

The Grammy Award-winning, internationally touring, purple velvet tuxedo-wearing, family-funk phenomenon, combines the positive, primal power of hip hop with the surreal storytelling of science fiction, celebrates individuality and imagination. When the funky beat and the bass groove drop, even the shyest kids get in on the action! About Secret Agent 23 Skidoo Secret Agent 23 Skidoo has concocted a potent potion that wows family crowds across the planet. The ingredients of his magic spells include reverence for the boundless mind-states of young children, re­spect for the culture of hip hop, funk and soul music, and a deep belief in the power of the imag­ination to change the world in positive ways. If you can imagine a band with Jim Henson on guitar, Shel Silverstein on bass and PIXAR as the lead vo­calist, you’ve pretty much got it. And if George Clinton and Q Tip stopped by the party, that might clarify things even more. If Dr. Seuss and Dr. Dre had a baby, it would be the music of Secret Agent 23 Skidoo. In 2007, Skidoo had already spent over a decade touring the nation with various live band/hip hop groups as a rapper and producer. He’d opened up for MOS DEF, RUN DMC, P-Funk All Stars and The Sun Ra Ark­estra. And best of all, he’d helped bring a beautiful baby girl, Saki, into the world. Taking a break from the road, Skidoo taught little Saki (aka MC Fireworks) how to rap, and together they made the world’s first album of family hip hop. It caught on quick, and they soon had a #1 hit on Siri­usXM’s family channel, which started planting seeds across the nation and beyond. In the next decade, they played Lollapalooza, Austin City Limits, and the Smithsonian. They flew to Canada for the Winnipeg Folk Festival, and to India for the Buddy Daddy Family Festival. They got glowing reviews in Time , USA Today , People , and racked up a total of ten #1 hits on SiriusXM, and ended up on NPR’s All Things Considered twice. Their music videos are currently playing on NBC’s kids’ show “Sprout House.” And in 2014, they got nominated for a Grammy, and in 2017, they won the Grammy for “Best Children’s Recording.” As well as releasing six full-length albums, two books, one record, a line of hot sauce, and an E.P. that combines the entire Asheville Symphony with beats and rhymes, 23 Skidoo has written and produced the music for the U.S. Library’s Summer Reading Program for six years running. In the decade of dancing down this crazy path, Secret Agent 23 Skidoo has evolved a sound and style that never dumbs down the music or underestimates the audience. With funk and beats as real as bands that play at midnight, and with lyrics that aren’t afraid to employ a larger vocabulary than what is currently heard on mainstream radio for adults, Skidoo fashions a world intended for the whole family. The universal constants that we all deal with, such as love, struggle, dreams, fear and learning to become our­selves, are the soul of these musical adventures that bounce, fly and slide smoothly through landscapes of wild imagination. Tickets are $5-$15 and are available online at performingarts.soka.edu , at the Box Office at 1 University Drive in Aliso Viejo or by calling (949) 480-4ART (4287).

The program includes: BACH/BRAHMS: Chaconne; BACH/RACHMANINOV: Prelude, Gavotte and Gigue; BACH/LISZT: Fantasia & Fugue in G minor; BACH: The Art of Fugue. About Daniil Trifonov Grammy Award-winning Russian pianist Daniil Trifonov, winner of Musical America’s 2019 Artist of the Year award, has made a spectacular ascent of the classical music world as a solo artist, champion of the concerto repertoire, chamber and vocal collaborator, and composer. Combining consummate technique with rare sensitivity and depth, his performances are a perpetual source of awe. Trifonov recently added a first Grammy Award to his already considerable string of honors, winning Best Instrumental Solo Album of 2018 with Transcendental, a Liszt collection that marked his third title as an exclusive Deutsche Grammophon artist. As The Times of London notes, he is “without question the most astounding pianist of our age.” This fall brings the release of Destination Rachmaninov: Arrival. Featuring the composer’s First and Third Concertos, this is the third volume of the Deutsche Grammophon series Trifonov recorded with the Philadelphia Orchestra and Yannick Nézet-Séguin, following Destination Rachmaninov: Departure, named BBC Music’s 2019 Concerto Recording of the Year, and Rachmaninov: Variations, a 2015 Grammy Award nominee. Later this fall, Trifonov inaugurates his multi-faceted, season-long tenure as 2019-20 Artist-in-Residence of the New York Philharmonic with accounts of Scriabin’s Piano Concerto under Jaap van Zweden. The residency also sees him take part in the New York premiere of his own Piano Quintet, and rejoin the music director and orchestra for Mozart’s 25th Piano Concerto, first in New York and then on a European tour that includes a stop at London’s Barbican. The Scriabin concerto is the vehicle for the pianist’s return to the New World Symphony under Michael Tilson Thomas, with whom he reunites for Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto with the Los Angeles Philharmonic and for Rachmaninov’s Fourth with the San Francisco Symphony, both at the orchestra’s home and on tour in Europe. Other upcoming orchestral highlights include Alexander Mosolov’s First Piano Concerto with the Nashville Symphony and Beethoven’s First and Fifth Piano Concertos with the Philadelphia Orchestra and Nézet-Séguin, as heard on the pianist’s DG Rachmaninov series. In recital this season, Trifonov tours a solo program of Bach transcriptions and The Art of Fugue to New York’s Lincoln Center, Chicago’s Orchestra Hall, Boston’s Celebrity Series, and destinations in Europe, besides partnering his mentor and fellow pianist Sergei Babayan at Carnegie Hall, Cornell University, Eastman School of Music, and in Dortmund, Germany. Trifonov launched the New York Philharmonic’s 2018-19 season with back-to-back performances, playing Ravel’s G-major Concerto at the opening-night gala and Beethoven’s “Emperor” Concerto the following night. He revisited the Ravel on tour with the London Symphony and Sir Simon Rattle, and during a residency at Vienna’s Musikverein, where he appeared with the Vienna Philharmonic and gave the Austrian premiere of his own Piano Concerto. The “Emperor” also took him to the London Symphony, National Symphony, Cincinnati Symphony, and Cleveland Orchestra, with which he toured Asia. Other orchestral highlights included performances of Scriabin’s concerto during a season-long residency with the Berlin Philharmonic, Prokofiev’s Third with the Chicago Symphony, Rachmaninov’s Third with the Boston Symphony, and Schumann’s concerto with longtime collaborator Valery Gergiev and the Met Orchestra at Carnegie Hall. Trifonov gave solo recitals of Beethoven, Schumann, and Prokofiev on Carnegie’s mainstage and in Berlin, where his Berlin Philharmonic residency featured multiple solo and chamber performances. These included accounts of his own Piano Quintet, of which he also gave the Cincinnati premiere with the Ariel Quartet, and a duo recital with German baritone Matthias Goerne, with whom he also appeared at New York’s 92nd Street Y. Other highlights of recent seasons include a seven-concert, season-long Carnegie Hall “Perspectives” series, crowned by a performance of Trifonov’s own piano concerto with Gergiev and the Mariinsky Orchestra; curating similar series at the Vienna Konzerthaus and in San Francisco, where the pianist gave a season-closing performance with the San Francisco Symphony; playing Tchaikovsky’s First under Riccardo Muti in the historic gala finale of the Chicago Symphony’s 125th anniversary celebrations; headlining complete Rachmaninoff concerto cycles at the New York Philharmonic’s Rachmaninoff Festival, with London’s Philharmonia Orchestra, and on tour with the Munich Philharmonic; undertaking Asian tours with the Czech Philharmonic and Rome’s Orchestra dell’Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia and European tours with the London Philharmonic, Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, and La Scala Orchestra; and making debuts at London’s BBC Proms and with the Chicago Symphony, Boston Symphony, Cleveland Orchestra, Philadelphia Orchestra, Montreal Symphony, Rome’s Orchestra dell’Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia, London’s Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic, the Berlin Staatskapelle, and the Berlin Philharmonic, where he headlined the orchestra’s famous New Year’s Eve concert under Sir Simon Rattle. Since making solo recital debuts at Carnegie Hall, London’s Wigmore Hall, Vienna’s Musikverein, Japan’s Suntory Hall, and Paris’s Salle Pleyel in 2012-13, Trifonov has given solo recitals at venues including the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C., Boston’s Celebrity Series, London’s Barbican and Royal Festival and Queen Elizabeth halls, Amsterdam’s Concertgebouw (Master Piano Series), Berlin’s Philharmonie, Munich’s Herkulessaal, Bavaria’s Schloss Elmau, Zurich’s Tonhalle, the Lucerne Piano Festival, the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Brussels, the Théâtre des Champs Élysées and Auditorium du Louvre in Paris, Barcelona’s Palau de la Musica, Tokyo’s Opera City, the Seoul Arts Center, and Melbourne’s Recital Centre. The 2013-14 season saw the release of Trifonov: The Carnegie Recital, the pianist’s first recording as an exclusive Deutsche Grammophon artist; captured live at his sold-out 2013 Carnegie Hall recital debut, the album scored a Grammy Award nomination. Besides the Grammy Award-winning Transcendental, Destination Rachmaninov: Departure, and the Grammy Award-nominated Rachmaninov Variations, Deutsche Grammophon has also issued Chopin Evocations, which pairs the composer’s works with those by the 20th-century composers he influenced. Trifonov’s discography also features a Chopin album for Decca and a recording of Tchaikovsky’s First Piano Concerto with Gergiev and the Mariinsky Orchestra on the ensemble’s own label. It was during the 2010-11 season that Trifonov won medals at three of the music world’s most prestigious competitions, taking Third Prize in Warsaw’s Chopin Competition, First Prize in Tel Aviv’s Rubinstein Competition, and both First Prize and Grand Prix – an additional honor bestowed on the best overall competitor in any category – in Moscow’s Tchaikovsky Competition. In 2013 he was awarded the prestigious Franco Abbiati Prize for Best Instrumental Soloist by Italy’s foremost music critics, and in 2016 he was named Gramophone’s Artist of the Year. Born in Nizhny Novgorod in 1991, Trifonov began his musical training at the age of five, and went on to attend Moscow’s Gnessin School of Music as a student of Tatiana Zelikman, before pursuing his piano studies with Sergei Babayan at the Cleveland Institute of Music. He has also studied composition, and continues to write for piano, chamber ensemble, and orchestra. When he premiered his own Piano Concerto in 2013, the Cleveland Plain Dealer marveled: “Even having seen it, one cannot quite believe it. Such is the artistry of pianist-composer Daniil Trifonov.” About Soka Performing Arts Center Now is in its ninth season of presenting the best of live performances on its extraordinary stage, Soka Performing Arts Center, located on the campus of Soka University of America in Aliso Viejo, California, is under the new leadership of General Manager Renee Bodie.

Perla Batalla sings her program “In the House of Cohen” to celebrate the legendary songwriter Leonard Cohen and his work. Rounding out the evening is the incomparable Maria Muldaur. Backed by her Red Hot Bluesiana Band, Muldaur will showcase the worldwide release of her newest CD “Don’t You Feel My Leg – The Naughty Bawdy Blues of Blue Barker.” Muldaur and the Band will also feature many of her chart-topping hits including, “Midnight at the Oasis.” Tickets are on sale now and start at $25-$50. They are available for purchase online at performingarts.soka.edu, at the Box Office at 1 University Drive in Aliso Viejo or by calling 949. 490.4278. About Perala Batalla Grammy Award-nominated singer-songwriter Perla Batalla consistently earns critical acclaim for her unique voice and culture-merging compositions.  Formerly a Leonard Cohen back-up singer, the Los Angeles born vocalist launched her solo career with Cohen’s encouragement. Since then she’s recorded seven albums, been featured in films and television, and taken her unique sound on tour in some of the most prestigious venues around the world. The Los Angeles Times writes, “Batalla is comfortable in both English and Spanish, proud of her mestiza heritage, musically adventurous and always accompanied by impeccable performers…. above all, she is a born storyteller with a rambunctious sense of humor.” Batalla was born in Los Angeles, California, to a family immersed in music; her father, a Mexican singer and radio personality, and an Argentine mother who ran a bustling record store called Discoteca Batalla. At the family record shop, literally at her mother’s knee, Batalla was exposed to an education of non-stop music that cut across genre and language. While her far-ranging influences are reflected in the eclectic choices of songs she writes, arranges and performs today, it is that voice that brings each song to a new light. Batalla’s mission of honoring her roots and exposing young audiences to the beauty of music and the Spanish language is ongoing with her outreach endeavors throughout some of the poorest communities in the United States. She is the recipient of the United Nation’s Earth Charter Award for “extraordinary devotion to social and economic justice” and the Premio Fronterizo Award for “healing work in the world.” About “In the House of Cohen” In 2015, Grammy Award-nominated singer Perla Batalla began pondering songs to include in a follow up CD to her 2007 tribute release to friend and mentor Leonard Cohen. As a longtime singer and touring band member with the legendary songwriter, Perla knew there was much of Cohen’s body of work she still wanted to perform and record. Batalla’s first Cohen CD, Bird on the Wire was produced with Leonard’s blessing; he attended the recording session, weighed-in on material, arrangements, and uncharacteristically participated in a photo session at his Los Angeles home to promote the project. Cohen’s passing in November 2016 reaffirmed Batalla’s mission of sharing the lesser-known songs of Canada’s poet laureate to a younger public mostly familiar with the well-covered, “Hallelujah.” She also wanted to dispel the too common mischaracterization of Cohen as “The Godfather of Gloom.” The man she knew was, more often than not, motivated by sly humor and absurdity. Perla Batalla in the House of Cohen features selected songs and rare personal anecdotes that serve to reveal Cohen’s lighter side (like Mr. Cohen’s deep affection for the .99 Cent Store and his delight at dining on hot dogs at Home Depot). The evening reveals the timelessness of Cohen’s art through Batalla’s signature cross-cultural style, to convey her sincere respect and deep love for the music, the poetry, and most of all for her dear friend, Leonard Cohen. “In this show, there are times when I ask my audience to sing with me,” Batalla says. “I feel that the coming together of voices has the power to touch Leonard’s spirit and his lifelong devotion to art and the mysteries of the human heart. Live music is about being in the moment, and I always have this secret expectation that as we lift our voices up together we will feel Leonard all around us…and we usually do.” About Maria Muldaur Maria Muldaur is best known worldwide for her 1974 mega-hit “Midnight at the Oasis,” which received several Grammy Award nominations and enshrined her forever in the hearts of Baby Boomers everywhere. Despite her considerable pop music success, Muldaur’s enduring career is best described as a long adventurous odyssey through the various forms of American roots music. During the folk revival of the early 1960s, she started exploring and singing early blues, bluegrass, Appalachian music, and began recording in 1963 with the Even Dozen Jug Band and, shortly thereafter, joining the popular Jim Kweskin Jug Band, touring and recording with them throughout the 1960s. Most recently, Muldaur was nominated as Best Female Blues Artist for the 2019 Blues Blast Music Awards. Muldaur’s long tour throughout the United States includes stops in most major cities, notably The Lincoln Center Midsummer’s Nights Swing Series in NYC, and the Annual Americana Music Honors & Awards Program at the Grand Ol’ Opry’s Ryman Auditorium in Nashville. Muldaur’s most recent release, her 41st album, “Don’t You Feel My Leg – The Naughty Bawdy Blues of Blue Barker” was nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best Traditional Blues category. Muldaur’s previous release gives a nod to one of music’s best kept secrets. Many have heard of Blues Great Bessie Smith, but very few have heard of Memphis Minnie. Memphis Minnie wrote over 200 songs, most of which were done by herself and her guitar playing husband. Muldaur has spent most of her career shining light on names that are lesser known, but who shaped contemporary music. “Minnie deserves our attention and gratitude” states Muldaur. “I have virtually everything she recorded. So much of her repertoire was early country blues, and I knew she’d migrated from the Memphis area to Chicago where she reigned as queen of the scene for many years. She was one of the first to plug in the guitar and go electric with “Chauffeur Blues.” Muldaur continues, “When I was 21, (Houston Blues singer) Victoria Spivey took me under her wing. She took a liking to me and invited me to be part of the Even Dozen Jug Band project. She took me to her apartment to look for songs that would be suitable to my voice and she played me a scratchy old 78 of Memphis Minnie singing ‘Tricks Ain’t Walking’ and that was it! I became a lifelong fan and devotee.” About Soka Performing Arts Center Now is in its ninth season of presenting the best of live performances on its extraordinary stage, Soka Performing Arts Center, located on the campus of Soka University of America in Aliso Viejo, California, is under the new leadership of General Manager Renee Bodie.

She was a charter member of the all-star ensemble, the SFJAZZ Collective, with whom she toured for six years. As a leader, Ms. Rosnes has released 17 acclaimed recordings. In 2016, Written in the Rocks (Smoke Sessions) was named one of ten Best Jazz Albums of the Year by The Chicago Tribune, one of the Best Albums in all genres of music by The Nation, and was awarded a 2017 Canadian Juno (her fifth Juno award). JazzTimes wrote, “Ms. Rosnes delivers conceptual heft, suspenseful compositions and mesmerizing performances,” and DownBeat praised it as “an exceptional achievement” stating “Rosnes is a virtuoso composer.” Renee is also the music director for ARTEMIS, a new international all-star band featuring the vocalist Cécile McLorin Salvant, clarinetist Anat Cohen, trumpeter Ingrid Jensen, tenor saxophonist Melissa Aldana, bassist Noriko Ueda and drummer Allison Miller. Rosnes is married to jazz pianist Bill Charlap, and the two often perform in a two-piano setting.

Between 1983 and 1986, Peter attended the University of California in Berkeley, where he majored in English Literature. Peter performed three seasons with the University of California Symphony Orchestra and two with the San Francisco Youth Symphony, but during his Berkeley years he had developed a growing interest in Jazz music: he started freelancing around the San Francisco Bay area with John Handy, Bobby Hutcherson, Harold Land, Frank Morgan, Ernestine Anderson, Chris Connor and other local celebrities. About Lewis Nash, drums Rhythm Is My Business is the title of his debut recording as a leader, and rhythm is a booming business as far as Lewis Nash is concerned. He is the drummer of choice for an incredible array of artists - from the masters of the music to the hottest young players of today - and is equally in demand as a clinician and educator. In 1981, Nash moved to New York City and joined the trio of the great jazz vocalist Betty Carter. For nearly four years, he toured internationally with Ms. Carter. He is featured on three of her recordings, including the Grammy winning Look What I Got. World-renowned bassist Ron Carter hired Nash in 1984. As a member Carter’s nonet, quintet and quartet, Nash toured extensively and is featured on several of the bassist’s recordings. Currently, while he continues to perform and record with a wide variety of artists, Nash leads several of his own exciting groups, from duo to septet. Outside of his many touring and recording accomplishments, thanks to the sponsorship of Sonor drums, Zildjian cymbals, Remo drumheads and Regal Tip drumsticks, Lewis has become a sought after jazz educator. His lectures, clinics and workshops are as much in demand as his bandstand and studio work.

About Jazzy Ash Jazzy Ash, also known as Ashli Christoval, grew up with her mother from New Orleans and her father from Trinidad. Music infused her home life every day, from jazz to Caribbean rhythms to the lively children’s music which was playing all the time for the kids in her mother’s home day care. She often spent summers in New Orleans with her aunts and grandparents, enjoying the culture and music that permeated their West Bank neighborhood. Later on, after becoming mom to two sons, she earned a degree in early childhood development and embarked on her music education program, Leaping Lizards Music. Jazzy Ash’s NOLA visits, especially during Mardi Gras, reaffirmed the importance of exploring this part of her heritage. “Learning about this music and performing it gives me a foundation. Truly, I’ve found myself through this experience. Even though I was born in California, I see myself as a second-generation New Orleanean, since New Orleans is so much a part of my family’s experience, going back at least seven generations.” Ash and her band, Jazzy Ash and the Leaping Lizards, have had the pleasure of performing at Lincoln Center and Symphony Space in New York, Getty Center in California, and World Cafe Live in Philadelphia, Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts, and Ann Arbor Summer Festival, among other prestigious venues. Additionally, Jazzy Ash continues to focus on education, regularly teaching performing arts to children and music education to educators. Most recently, Jazzy Ash has hosted workshops for National HeadStart, NAEYC, and MaxFunCon. Her music has been featured in the Los Angeles Times and NPR, and continues to top the Children’s Music Charts.

About the Siberian State Symphony Orchestra The Siberian State Symphony Orchestra dates back to 1977. Very quickly in its early history, the orchestra, then led by eminent Soviet conductor Ivan Shpiller, won the reputation as one of the best orchestras in former Soviet Union. SSSO has worked with conductors such as Leonard Slatkin, Dmitri Jurowski, Gintaras Rinkevicius, Vladislav Chernushenko among others, and performed regularly with the soloists Mikhail Pletnev, Vadim Repin, Dmitri Hvorostovsky, Lazar Berman, Igor Oistrakh, Denis Matsuev, Rudolf Buchbinder, and Nikolai Lugansky, to name a few. After the fall of the Iron Curtain, the Siberian State Symphony started touring internationally to critical acclaim. In 1993, by the special Decree of the Russian Ministry of Culture, the Orchestra was awarded the title of State Orchestra and, in 2009, received the venerable status of a Particularly Valuable Object of Cultural Heritage. In 2015 Vladimir Lande became orchestra’s new Artistic Director and Chief Conductor. Since then, SSSO has started successful new collaborations with international recording labels such as Naxos, Delos, and Parma Records and orchestra’s televised concerts became available for online streaming. The orchestra and its new Artistic Director are not only maintaining the high performing standards but also dedicate significant amount of time to their mission as educators in the region of Central Siberia. About Vladimir Lande Russian-American conductor Vladimir Lande is the music director and conductor of the Siberian State Symphony Orchestra (Krasnoyarsk, Russia).

{"newspaper": "soka-news", "url": "https://www.soka.edu/news-events/news/soka-performing-arts-center-presents-harry-allen-trio", "title": "Soka Performing Arts Center Presents Harry Allen Trio", "text": "(Aliso Viejo, CA, November 19, 2019) – Soka Performing Arts Center presents the Harry Allen Trio on Saturday, February 1, 2020 at 8pm. Considered a throwback since his choice of material is jazz standards, Allen’s style has been described as jazz music played the way it was “meant” to be played: with confidence, straight-forward and without fussiness or frivolity, beautifully, and with the melody of the saxophone up front. The trio includes Harry Allen, tenor sax; Ehud Asherie, piano; Chuck Redd, drums. About Harry Allen, tenor sax Harry Allen has over thirty recordings to his name. Three of Harry’s CDs have won Gold Disc Awards from Japan’s Swing Journal Magazine, and his CD Tenors Anyone? won both the Gold Disc Award and the New Star Award. His recordings have made the top ten list for favorite new releases in Swing Journal Magazine’s reader’s poll and Jazz Journal International’s critic’s poll for 1997. Eu Nao Quero Dancar (I Won’t Dance), the third Gold Disc Award winner, was voted second for album of the year for 1998 by Swing Journal Magazine’s reader’s poll. Harry has performed at jazz festivals and clubs worldwide, frequently touring the United States, Europe and Asia. He has performed with Rosemary Clooney, Sheryl Crow, Kenny Barron, Dave McKenna, Dori Caymmi, Larry Goldings, George Mraz, Jake Hanna, and Al Foster, among others. He is featured on many of John Pizzarelli’s recordings including the soundtrack and an on-screen cameo in the feature film The Out of Towners starring Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn. Harry was born in Washington D.C. in 1966, and was raised in Los Angeles, CA and Burrillville, RI. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in music in 1988 from Rutgers University in New Jersey, and currently resides in New York City. About Ehud Asherie, piano Largely self-taught, or rather, “old-schooled,” Asherie learned the ropes at Smalls, spending much of his early teens becoming a fixture of the late-night jam sessions held at this now legendary Greenwich Village club in New York City. Mentored by the late Frank Hewitt, Asherie began to develop “his virtuosity and his ear for clean, crisp lines” (The Star-Ledger). Later, an admiration for earlier piano styles took hold; soon enough Asherie had absorbed them into his playing becoming, in the words of The New Yorker, “A master of swing and stride.” His present style combines this broad tradition, merging idioms into a distinctly personalized approach. Among numerous albums recorded as sideman, acclaimed album releases under Ehud Asherie’s leadership have included Shuffle Along which reinterpreted the music of Eubie Blake; Organic, which finds Asherie on organ; and Upper West Side and Lower East Side, duet projects featuring the saxophonist Harry Allen and his trio recording Music Makes Me. Asherie’s most recent trio recording is Wild Man Blues on the Capri Label. Ehud has worked with a broad range of musicians including Cécile McLorin Salvant, Wycliffe Gordon, Catherine Russell, John Pizzarelli, and Charles McPherson, and has performed at clubs and festivals in South America, Europe, Asia, and throughout the U.S. His playing can be heard on numerous celebrated recordings, including the 2010 Grammy Award winning soundtrack of HBO’s Boardwalk Empire. About Chuck Redd, drums Chuck Redd is well known internationally as a performer on drums and vibraphone. Chuck began recording and touring the globe when he joined the Charlie Byrd Trio at the age of 21. He also became a member of the Great Guitars (Barney Kessel, Byrd and Herb Ellis). To his credit are 25 European tours and six tours of Japan with the Barney Kessel Trio, Ken Peplowski and the Benny Goodman Tribute Orchestra, Terry Gibbs and Conte Candoli. He served as Artist-In-Residence at The Smithsonian Jazz Café in Washington D.C. from 2004-2008. Chuck is the 2019 musical director of The Oregon Festival of American Music. He is a featured soloist annually at The W.C. Handy Music Festival, The Newport Beach Jazz Party, The West Texas Jazz Party, The North Carolina Jazz Festival and The Roswell Jazz Festival. Chuck was featured vibraphonist with the Mel Torme All-Star Jazz Quintet from 1991 until 1996. Chuck’s career highlights include a concert with the Dizzy Gillespie Quintet in Africa for the Namibian Independence Celebration, a recital at the White House with the Barney Kessel Trio, four concerts at Carnegie Hall with the Mel Torme Quintet, The Great Guitars and The Charlie Byrd Trio and an appearance on The Tonight Show.

Tom Harrell Quartet with Hubert Laws | Saturday, October 26, 2019 at 8PM Tom Harrell was voted Trumpeter of the Year of 2018 by the Jazz Journalists Association. He is one of the most creative and dynamic jazz instrumentalists and composers of our time. While Harrell is a master of the jazz idiom, he constantly seeks new challenges and influences. His warm, burnished sound on the trumpet and the flugelhorn, and the unparalleled melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic sophistication in his playing and writing, have earned Harrell his place as a jazz icon to aspiring musicians and devoted fans alike. Winner of the 2011 NEA Jazz Masters Award and Grammy Award nominee Hubert Laws, who is the premier musician on flute in jazz, joins Harrell for an exceptional night of music. In addition to the award by the JJA, Harrell also received the Award of Recognition by the Festival of New Trumpet Music. He is a frequent winner in DownBeat and JazzTimes magazines’ Critics and Readers Polls and a multiple-Grammy nominee. Harrell is joined by Mark Turner on tenor sax, Charles Altura on electric and acoustic guitars, Ben Street on bass, and Johnathan Blake on drums, with Adam Cruz playing percussion on one track (“Hope”) on his newest album Infinity . It is also the ﬁrst time that Harrell has recorded in a quintet format with tenor sax and guitar. “The music on Infinity has some interesting textures with multiple guitar overdubs. This is something I have never done before. I was trying some harmonic ideas that are new to me” says Harrell. Harrell’s music is at once intelligent, soulful, fresh, and accessible. No matter the size of the group he works with, the trumpeter-composer deftly weaves complex and innovative harmonies together with daring rhythmic concepts and unforgettable melodies while utilizing the available colors to full effect. The last 10 years have ushered Harrell through a singularly fruitful period. While continuing to tour actively around the world, he has produced an average of one album a year with each successive release markedly distinct from its predecessor. About Hubert Laws Internationally renowned flutist Hubert Laws is one of the few classical artists who has also mastered jazz, pop, and rhythm-and-blues genres; moving effortlessly from one repertory to another. He has appeared as a soloist with the New York Philharmonic under Zubin Mehta, with the orchestras of Los Angeles, Dallas, Chicago, Cleveland, Amsterdam, Japan, and Detroit, and with the Stanford String Quartet.

In addition, he has appeared at the Montreux, Playboy, and Kool Jazz festivals; he performed with the Modern Jazz Quartet at the Hollywood Bowl in 1982 and with the Detroit Symphony in 1994.

Luis Perdomo, piano Ugonna Okegwo, acoustic bass Adam Cruz, drums Harry Allen Trio | Saturday, February 1, 2020 at 8PM Harry Allen has been described as a throwback since his choice of material is jazz standards. This is jazz music played the way it was “meant” to be played: with confidence, straight-forward and without fussiness or frivolity, beautifully, and with the melody of the saxophone up front. Gene Lees writes, “Stan Getz was once asked his idea of the perfect tenor saxophone soloist. His answer was, ‘My technique, Al Cohn’s ideas, and Zoot’s time.’ The fulfillment of that ideal may well be embodied in … Harry Allen.” Allen has recorded more than 70 CDs as a leader and many more as a sideman. Three of Allen’s CDs have won Gold Disc Awards from Japan’s Swing Journal Magazine , and his CD Tenors Anyone? won both the Gold Disc Award and the New Star Award. His recordings have made the top ten list for favorite new releases in Swing Journal Magazine ’s readers’ poll and Jazz Journal International ’s critics’ poll for 1997, and Eu Nao Quero Dancar ( I Won’t Dance ), the third Gold Disc Award winner, was voted second for album of the year for 1998 by Swing Journal Magazine ’s readers’ poll. The Harry Allen-Joe Cohn Quartet won the New York Nightlife Award for Outstanding Jazz Combo Performance of 2006 and was nominated for Best Jazz Combo by the Jazz Journalists Association for the same year. Allen also won the 2010 New York Nightlife Award for Best Jazz Solo. Allen has performed at jazz festivals and clubs worldwide, frequently touring the United States, Europe, and Asia. He has performed with Rosemary Clooney, Jay Geils, Ray Brown, Hank Jones, Frank Wess, Flip Phillips, Scott Hamilton, Harry “Sweets” Edison, Kenny Burrell, Herb Ellis, John Pizzarelli, Bucky Pizzarelli, Gus Johnson, Jeff Hamilton, Terry Gibbs, Warren Vache, and has recorded with Tony Bennett, Johnny Mandel, Ray Brown, Tommy Flanagan, James Taylor, Sheryl Crow, Kenny Barron, Dave McKenna, Dori Caymmi, Larry Goldings, George Mraz, Jake Hanna, and Al Foster. Allen is featured on many of John Pizzarelli’s recordings including the soundtrack and an on-screen cameo in the feature film The Out of Towners starring Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn. He has also done a series of commercials for ESPN starring Robert Goulet. Allen was born in Washington, DC, in 1966 and was raised in Los Angeles and Burrillville, RI. He received a bachelor of arts degree in music in 1988 from Rutgers University in New Jersey, and currently resides in New York City.

She has recorded 17 albums as a leader and worked with many of the great jazz masters, including Joe Henderson, Wayne Shorter, Bobby Hutcherson, J. J. Johnson, James Moody, and Ron Carter. Rosnes is a true jazz monster with the killer combination of her beautiful, complex, and virtuoso writing, and her brilliant, passionate, and technically astounding playing. Upon moving to New York City from Vancouver, she quickly established a reputation of high regard. She was a charter member of the all-star ensemble, the SFJAZZ Collective, with whom she toured for six years. As a leader, Rosnes has released 17 acclaimed recordings.

JazzTimes wrote, “Ms. Rosnes delivers conceptual heft, suspenseful compositions and mesmerizing performances,” and DownBeat praised it as “an exceptional achievement” stating “Rosnes is a virtuoso composer.” The band’s most recent session, Beloved of the Sky (2018) draws inspiration for the title track from Canadian painter Emily Carr, and features master musicians Chris Potter, Steve Nelson, Peter Washington, and Lenny White. Rosnes has produced concerts at Jazz at Lincoln Center, the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, and the 92nd Street Y in New York City. Rosnes is also the music director for Artemis, a new international all-star band featuring the vocalist Cécile McLorin Salvant, clarinetist Anat Cohen, trumpeter Ingrid Jensen, tenor saxophonist Melissa Aldana, bassist Noriko Ueda, and drummer Allison Miller.

In this spirit this Charleston, SC, based quintet performs timeless music of Gullah - from playful game songs to joyful shouts, from wrenching spirituals to soft lullabies – and mixes traditions of the Lowcountry with large doses of jazz, gospel, funk and R&B. Their debut album was featured on NPR’s Fresh Air with Terry Gross and NBC’s the Today show. It also soared to the #1 position on the Billboard, Amazon, and iTunes Jazz Charts. About Gullah Music The Gullah-Geechee are the descendants of African people who were brought to this country to do slave labor on coastal plantations stretching from Wilmington, North Carolina, to Jacksonville, Florida. In the Carolinas, these people are known as Gullahs; in Georgia and Florida, they are called Geechees. Gullah-Geechee people have retained many African customs, including religious beliefs and traditions, music, food, and remnants of native African languages. The Gullah-Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor was established by the U.S. Congress in 2006. It includes 79 barrier islands, and communities as far as 30 miles inland on the mainland. The Corridor is managed by the National Park Service. The ancestors of the Gullah embraced the “medicinal” feelings they siphoned from the music they made in the fields and during their religious ceremonies. For the slaves, the drum was the focal point of the music - and in certain ways it was even used as a communication device. Slave owners feared that the slaves could use their drums to conspire and plot plans of escape. Due to this, Africans brought to America were not allowed to have drums. As a result of the necessity for a beat in African and Gullah music, it is said people would bang walking sticks on the wooden floors of their buildings in order to take the place of a drum. One of the most interesting musical practices of the African slaves, that is still carried out today, was the ring shout. The ring shout is a religious ritual straight from Africa, which consists of clapping, shuffling, stomping, and revolving around in a ring shape. The history of Gullah music is extremely rich and has a deep connection with its African roots and ancestors. In fact, much of the music that we listen to today, including Jazz, blues, ragtime, gospel and ‘soul music’, would not even exist had it not been for the influence of African and Gullah music on the world.

Mendes first made an impact in collaboration with Antônio Carlos Jobim and Cannonball Adderley, and came to international stardom with his iconic band Brasil ’66. “The man who put go-go boots on Brazilian music and brought it to the world” (Billboard), Mendes jettisoned thoughts of a classical career when the distinctive jazz-meets-samba fusion called bossa nova began to evolve in the clubs of Rio in the late 50s. One of the most internationally successful Brazilian artists of all time, Mendes has recorded more than 35 albums, many of which went gold or platinum. In 2012 Mendes received his first Oscar nomination in the music category for “Real In Rio” from the animated, 3-D feature film Rio . In addition to being the Executive Music Producer for the blockbuster film, he also contributed five songs to the movie. The soundtrack, Rio: Music from the Motion Picture , featured re-recorded versions of his hits “Mas Que Nada” and “Valsa Carioca.” Mendes, once again, was responsible for bringing the distinctive rhythms of Brazil to a global audience. Mendes again provided the music for the sequel, Rio 2 . Mendes started his career with 1961’s Dance Moderno and the groups Bossa Rio and the Sergio Mendes Trio. From the mid-1960s to the late ’70s, Mendes established his legendary status by taking numerous albums and singles to the top of the charts. But it was Sergio Mendes and Brasil ’66 which sparked global stardom. Performing “The Look of Love” at the 1968 Oscars, their version went top 10, quickly followed by the hits “The Fool on the Hill” and “Scarborough Fair.” Enjoying immense popularity, Mendes added soul and funk to his jazz and pop, but always with a Brazilian rhythm. His earlier single, “Mas Que Nada,” marked the first time that a song sung entirely in Portuguese hit Billboard’s Pop chart in the US. Mendes’ signature mix of bossa nova/samba and his distinctive pop instrumentation features melodies with distinct sophistication and alluring sexiness that ultimately came to define Brazilian music for many music enthusiasts around the world. In the ’80s, he scored with the No. 1 Adult Contemporary and pop top-10 hit “Never Gonna Let You Go.” And in 1992 Mendes was awarded his first Grammy in the category of Best World Music for his album Brasileiro . Since then, Mendes has gone on to be honored with two Latin Grammys for Best Brazilian Record, Timeless (2006) and Bom Tempo (2010), which was also nominated for a 2010 Grammy. Mendes’ innovation and versatility has enabled him to collaborate with a wide a range of artists. In 2006, his Timeless CD was a collaboration with contemporary pop, rock, urban and hip-hop artists, including Justin Timberlake, John Legend, and Black Eyed Peas—with a re-recording of his early gem “Mas Que Nada” alongside Gracinha Leporace, Mendes’ wife. 2008’s Encanto featured neo-soulster Ledisi and Spanish-language favorite Juanes. In 2011, Mendes released his 39th album , Celebration: A Musical Journey , which represented his 50 years as a recording artist and included classics from his career as well as new recordings with Ivete Sangalo and Siedah Garrett, among them a remake of “The Fool on the Hill.” He also performed the classic at the 2011 MusiCares Gala Honoring Sir Paul McCartney. Mendes’ iconic album: Herb Alpert Presents Sergio Mendes & Brasil ’66 was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, joining Bruce Springsteen’s Born In The U.S.A ., Dr. Martin Luther King Jr’s “I Have A Dream” speech, the Rolling Stones’ Exile On Main St ., and others in the 2012 class of historically significant recordings. 2014 saw the release of his album Magic , a collection of new songs, recorded with a host of friends and special guests including John Legend, Will.I.Am, Carlinhos Brown, and more. Magic also featured the 2014 World Cup hit single “One Nation.” Mendes continues to tour worldwide.", "categories": ["Performing Arts Center"], "date_publish": "July 22, 2019", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Most musicians hope at most for proficiency in their chosen form, but these gentlemen move from bluegrass to Western classical to Indian classical to jazz, transmuting genres into something uniquely their own as though they had gotten hold of the alchemist’s tools that legendarily changed lead into gold.  In any case, its music that transcends description; ineffable, indefinable, and beautiful. A harmonic convergence of virtuosity, the trio reunites on stage to celebrate the 10th Anniversary of their Grammy Award-nominated 2009 album The Melody of Rhythm – Triple Concerto & Music for Trio. “Beyond category.’ That’s what Duke Ellington used to call musicians who were simply the best at what they do. And that’s certainly the case for Béla Fleck, Edgar Meyer and Zakir Hussain”-  NPR Music About Béla Fleck Just in case you aren’t familiar with Béla Fleck, there are some who say he’s the premiere banjo player in the world. Others claim that Mr. Fleck has virtually reinvented the image and the sound of the banjo through a remarkable performing and recording career that has taken him all over the musical map and on a range of solo projects and collaborations. If you are familiar with Mr. Fleck, you know that he just loves to play the banjo, and put it into unique settings. The recipient of multiple Grammy Awards and nominations going back to 1998, Mr. Flecks’ total Grammy Award count is 15 won, with 30 nominations. He has been nominated in more categories than any instrumentalist in Grammy Award history. After a transformational stint in the pivotal progressive bluegrass collective New Grass Revival, Fleck co-founded the Flecktones in the late ’80s, flinging open the doors of bluegrass fusion with an entire world of sound—funk, hip-hop, rock, classical, jazz. In recent years Mr. Fleck found himself bouncing among various intriguing touring situations, such as duos with Chick Corea, Chris Thile and Abigail Washburn, in a trio with Zakir Hussain and Edgar Meyer, performing his concertos with symphonies, concerts with the Brooklyn Rider string quartet, performances with African artists such as Oumou Sangare and Toumani Diabate, in jazz collaboration with The Marcus Roberts Trio, rare solo concerts and doing bluegrass with his old friends. And after nearly 30 years, the Flecktones are still performing together. About Zakir Hussain Zakir Hussain is today appreciated both in the field of percussion and in the music world at large as an international phenomenon and one of the greatest musicians of our time. A classical tabla virtuoso of the highest order, his consistently brilliant and exciting performances have established him as a national treasure in his own country, India, and as one of India’s reigning cultural ambassadors. Along with his legendary father and teacher, Ustad Allarakha, he has elevated the status of his instrument both in India and around the world. His playing is marked by uncanny intuition and masterful improvisational dexterity, founded in formidable knowledge and study. Widely considered a chief architect of the contemporary world music movement, Mr. Hussain’s contribution to world music has been unique, with many historic collaborations, including Shakti, which he founded with John McLaughlin and L. Shankar, Remember Shakti, the Diga Rhythm Band, Making Music, Planet Drum with Mickey Hart, Tabla Beat Science, Sangam with Charles Lloyd and Eric Harland, and recordings and performances with artists as diverse as George Harrison, Yo-Yo Ma, Joe Henderson, Van Morrison, Airto Moreira, Pharoah Sanders, Billy Cobham, Mark Morris, Rennie Harris, and the Kodo drummers. His music and extraordinary contribution to the music world were honored in April, 2009, with four widely-heralded and sold-out concerts at Carnegie Hall’s Artist Perspective series. About Edgar Meyer In demand as both a performer and a composer, Edgar Meyer has formed a role in the music world unlike any other.  Hailed by The New Yorker as “…the most remarkable virtuoso in the relatively un-chronicled history of his instrument,” Mr. Meyer’s unparalleled technique and musicianship in combination with his gift for composition have brought him to the fore.  His uniqueness in the field was recognized by a MacArthur Award in 2002. As a composer, Mr. Meyer has carved out a remarkable and unique niche in the musical world.  His music has been premiered and recorded by Emanuel Ax, Joshua Bell, Yo-Yo Ma, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Bela Fleck, Zakir Hussain, Hilary Hahn, and the Emerson String Quartet, among others. Collaborations are a central part of Mr. Meyer’s work.  He has been and remains a member of numerous groups whose members include Chris Thile, Bela Fleck, Zakir Hussain, Sam Bush, Jerry Douglas, Mark O’Connor, Yo-Yo Ma, Emanuel Ax, Joshua Bell, Mike Marshall, and Amy Dorfman, among others.  His debut album in 1985 featured the first public appearance of Strength in Numbers, whose members were Bush, Douglas, Fleck, O’Connor, and Meyer. Mr. Meyer began studying bass at the age of five under the instruction of his father and continued further to study with Stuart Sankey.  In 1994 he received the Avery Fisher Career Grant and in 2000 became the only bassist to receive the Avery Fisher Prize.  Currently, he teaches bass in partnership with Hal Robinson at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. As a solo classical bassist, Mr. Meyer can be heard on a concerto album with the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra conducted by Hugh Wolff featuring Bottesini and Meyer concertos both alone and with Yo-Yo Ma and Joshua Bell.  He has also recorded an album featuring three of Bach’s Unaccompanied Suites for Cello.  Mr. Meyer was honored with his fifth Grammy® Award in 2015 for Best Contemporary Instrumental album for his Bass & Mandolin collaboration with Chris Thile. About Rakesh Chaurasia Rakesh Chaurasia, the nephew and child prodigy of flute maestro Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia, has a famous name to live up to. Amongst the promising musicians of the second generation, Mr. Chaurasia has carved a niche for himself as an accomplished flautist. Incorporating the tradition of his renowned uncle and infusing his personal style, he has evolved a style which while maintaining the purity of the flute manages to capture the attention of the young listeners too. The most accomplished of disciples of his uncle, however, shows all the promise to carry the Chaurasia legacy to new heights. Mr. Chaurasia’s flute has matched note and rhythm with wind instruments of other cultures as well as having performed ‘jugalbandis’ with Carnatic and world famous instrumentalists. His forte is in blending his flute without really losing its identity in mixed instruments’ concerts. Mr. Chaurasia has already globe trotted many times over, enthralling audiences at classical and non-classical concerts. He is also an accomplished studio musician having recorded with most of the leading stalwarts of the Indian film industry. Mr. Chaurasia has been the recipient of numerous awards and accolades. He received the Indian Music Academy Award, presented by the Honourable President Of India, Dr..A.P.J Abdul Kalam in 2007, the Aditya Birla Kalakiran Puraskar in 2008, the Guru Shishya Award in 2011, IWAP-Pandit Jasraj Sangeet Ratna Award in 2013 and the Pannalal Ghosh Puraskar 2013.

{"newspaper": "soka-news", "url": "https://www.soka.edu/news-events/news/soka-performing-arts-center-presents-legendary-songwriter-jimmy-webb", "title": "Soka Performing Arts Center Presents Legendary Songwriter Jimmy Webb", "text": "(Aliso Viejo, CA, August 28, 2019) –Songwriter Jimmy Webb has had chart-topping hits in a unique range of genres, from country to pop to disco, with songs including “Worst That Could Happen,” “Wichita Lineman,” “Up, Up and Away” and “MacArthur Park.”   But perhaps the most enduring partnership out of all those memorable songs is his musical brotherhood with Glen Campbell. Now in his touring multi-media show Jimmy Webb: The Glen Campbell Years (Saturday, October 5, 2019 at 8PM) Webb brings fans of his music a unique connection to their favorite songs, revealing the stories behind the legacy he created with his friend Glen Campbell.  Webb also shares his stories in his recent literary memoir The Cake and the Rain (St. Martin’s Press) now available in paperback and audiobook read by Webb himself. In Webb’s very personal concert, he pays homage to his friend and collaborator, with performances including virtual duets, new music videos, and stories of how these iconic songs came to be.  A gifted composer whose complicated chords and song structures could not be performed by just anybody and a natural-born musician with an almost unnatural vocal range and musical abilities — theirs was a fated partnership that began before they even met. Webb’s moving and often humorous account through performance and anecdotes — punctuated with photos, video and audio clips — offers a rare window into the process by which songs become radio hits. In concert and in the memoir, Webb shares the genesis of the duo’s Grammy-winning collaborations, much of which happened before they even met.   Performing some of the treasure trove of gems he wrote for Campbell, Webb pulls the audience in with various accounts each night of the personal side of generational touchstones like “Honey Come Back.” A centerpiece of the concert is when Webb trades verses with recordings of Campbell and adds insights to “By the Time I Get to Phoenix,” “Wichita Lineman” and more from various recent performances by the duo. Personal video and photos from Webb’s private collection and from other friends, mostly never-before-seen, bring back decades of shared musical memories.  In addition, Webb peppers the evening with many surprises that demonstrate the singular talents of these two pop icons and the indelible mark their symbiotic craftsmanship made on American music, and all over the world. Jimmy Webb: The Glen Campbell Years follows the trajectory of these men’s careers as they relate to each other but also encompasses the emotions and experiences that the songs they produced together mean to their fans. When his songwriting style is expanded in the longer format of a memoir, Webb gives the reader a new kind of access to pivotal moments like their first meeting, which under any circumstances other than the particular atmosphere of the 1960s should not have spawned a decades-long friendship. The Cake and the Rain is a surprising and unusual book. Webb’s talent as a writer and storyteller is on every page, rich with a sense of time and place. Readers share his experiences as he moves from simple and sere Oklahoma to fast and fantastical Los Angeles. About Jimmy Webb Jimmy Webb’s numerous accolades include the prestigious Ivor Novella International Award (2012) and the Academy of Country Music’s Poet Award (2016).  Webb was named in the top 50 of Rolling Stone’s 2015 “Greatest Songwriters of All Time.”  He received his first gold record at the age of 18, and was the youngest inductee into the Songwriters Hall of Fame (which he later chaired).  He is the only artist to ever receive Grammy Awards for music, lyrics, and orchestration. Webb’s first book, Tunesmith: Inside the Art of Songwriting, is considered a “bible” among professional musicians. He has time and again paved the way for songwriters in the ever-changing media landscape, pioneering commercial use of pop songs (“Up, Up and Away” as the centerpiece of the 1970 Trans World Airlines campaign) and spearheading the ongoing effort to preserve the rights of songwriters and their intellectual property rights on the board of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP). Webb has released a dozen solo albums since the 1970s, while continuing to write for other artists.  His CDs Just Across the River (2010) and Still Within the Sound of My Voice (2013) feature duets on some of his biggest songs with friends Billy Joel, Vince Gill, Willie Nelson, Linda Ronstadt, Lucinda Williams, Mark Knopfler, Brian Wilson, Art Garfunkel, David Crosby, Graham Nash, Lyle Lovett, Keith Urban, and more. In 2016, Webb premiered his first classical piece, “Nocturne for Piano and Orchestra (Nocturne for “Lefty”)” with Orchestra Kentucky.  His brilliantly written memoir, The Cake and the Rain (St. Martin’s Press) brings Webb’s unique career into focus, written with the same sense of poetry and story as his many hits. In Webb’s latest release, a CD titled SlipCover (April, 2019), he shares his piano arrangements of what he considers the finest compositions of his generation.  Featured are songs written by The Rolling Stones, Randy Newman, Billy Joel and Paul McCartney.

The program allows students to gain a competitive edge in the marketplace, start their career sooner, and save on tuition by having to complete fewer graduate school courses. The Claremont Graduate Scholars Program, which began in March 2019, offers SUA students preferred access to accelerated degrees in four tracks: education (with an MA or MA + teaching credential), management (with an MBA from the CGU Drucker School of Management), and international studies (with an MA in international studies). Soka students can apply during their junior year; CGU waives the GRE requirement and application fees. Admitted students take one to three SUA courses that will transfer to their CGU MA degree (depending on the degree program). They are also eligible to take CGU courses during their senior year. In addition, CGU provides $10,000 fellowships to SUA students, and SUA offers up to five $10,000 scholarships based on merit. Taylor Gonzales ’19 is one of three Soka alumni currently in CGU’s accelerated program. Though it was announced only months before her graduation, she has still capitalized on the program’s benefits. Gonzales’ expectations were low when she applied as she thought she might be too late, and she was excited to be accepted. She is now pursuing a master’s in education with a concentration in student affairs and educational justice. Her goal? To become a director of student affairs at a liberal arts college. The CGU program is designed for students who also work full-time, which allows Gonzales to hold an internship with CGU’s Office of Admissions. While working there she learned that CGU would retroactively accept eight credits from her Soka coursework, allowing her to graduate a semester early in December. We talked to Gonzales about her experience in the program. What made you want to study education at CGU? Throughout high school and even college, I had a hard time choosing exactly what career I would pursue. I went from wanting to be a marine biologist to a teacher to even wanting to work in astronomy. Once I got to Soka, I was introduced to career service counselor Robyn Dizes. After talking with her a couple of times, I started to realize that I might like to do the same thing as she did. I wanted to guide students who were a little lost and needed some kind of direction in choosing their next step, whether it will be attending grad school or getting an internship or job. College students are especially interesting to me because they have a lot of passion and a sense of self. What do you like about CGU? What I really love is that—similar to Soka—this institution is very small so you get that one-to-one with professors, faculty, etc. My largest class so far has had 12 students. I also really like that this program offers the chance for me to get real work experience while I’m still in school. It’s great to actually be able to practice using what I learn in class. For my practicum, I have been working at Harvey Mudd College for the ResLife division as well as in the Office of Health and Wellness. Because I’m working remotely, I’m able to do both, and it’s made me realize that I’m actually really interested in health and wellness. There’s a lot I don’t know that I want to learn more about. Another thing about CGU is that if you want to get your PhD here after getting your master’s, you’re able to transfer either half or all of your master’s credits toward it. That cuts the time you spend in school and keeps the cost down. If I ever decide to get a PhD, I think I would come back to CGU. How was the transition between Soka and CGU? It was seamless. I made about half of my current friends just on the first day of orientation, and I’ve gotten the chance to take a class with every single one of them. It’s great having that support system. We’re all here for the same reasons: we want a good education, and we like getting that personalized attention from professors. All the students being in the same mindset is really helpful. In this sense, it’s very similar to Soka, so I really like that. Any advice to students who are thinking about attending CGU? I wish I had gone to more school events while I was still on campus. Don’t be afraid to go to those events, because you’ll never know who you’re going to connect with and who might have an opening for you in the future. Be open to any and all possibilities. At CGU, you’ll be able to meet a lot of people and network fairly easily, but you do have to put yourself out there a little bit and then things will come to you. —by Nagisa Smalheiser ‘21", "categories": ["Undergraduate Academics", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "October 15, 2020", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Another time, she organized a structured dialogue among relevant groups after a protest directed at her office. Pembroke, deputy regional program coordinator at the International Organization for Migration, UN Migration Agency in Nairobi, Kenya, was one of four Soka alumni who spoke at the 7th Annual Dialogue on the Culture of Peace and Non-Violence about how they have used the power of dialogue in their work. “I believe dialogue with action is about respect,” said Pembroke, “but also the courage to be open and vulnerable.” This year’s dialogue, “Living the Culture of Peace in 2020,” was held virtually on Oct. 2 due to the pandemic. The event commemorated the spirit of the 1999 United Nations Declaration and Programme of Action on the Culture of Peace. It also honored the vision of SUA founder Daisaku Ikeda and Ambassador Anwarul K. Chowdhury, former under secretary general and high representative of the United Nations, for their lifelong commitment to building a culture of peace that has provided the inspiration for the annual dialogues. Vice President for Academic Affairs Michael Weiner opened the event, and moderator Tetsushi Ogata, visiting assistant professor of peace and conflict studies, noted that one benefit of the pandemic was that people from all over the globe could attend. Students, staff, and faculty joined the event from across the US, as well as countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Dominican Republic, India, Japan, Russia, Somalia, Taiwan, and Venezuela. Ogata asserted the importance of putting SUA’s founding principles into action during this challenging year. “Now is the time when we need a culture of peace, more than ever, because our society faces significant challenges,” he said. “But it is also true that when we need a culture of peace, such an ideal seems to be drifting further away from us.” The speakers who followed Ogata each reflected on how SUA’s liberal arts education contributed to their own efforts in building a culture of peace during both a global health crisis and a time of social upheaval. After Mitsue described her experiences of “having dialogue with people who did not seek dialogue initially,” Leonard Bogdonoff ’11, chief technology officer and co-founder of Milk video in New York, discussed his experiences working in the tech field. Bogdonoff, who has worked in the private and public sectors, and said he has a particular passion for connecting art and technology, observed that Soka taught him to see even worldly pursuits like power, wealth, and fame as opportunities “to seek new values” by learning from people who are different from you and using one’s creativity to impact the world. Born and raised in Kenosha, Wisconsin, Jennifer Cook ’11 described experiencing inequalities in the classroom firsthand as a mixed-race person. Cook is now lead learning behavior specialist at Noble Street College Prep in Chicago, and emphasized the importance of engaging in dialogue with the youth “on what it means to exist,” which, for her, is the basis of “creating values in the classroom.” Anna Taeko Casals Fernandez ’18, a consultant at the World Bank and the International Organization for Migration, UN Migration Agency, described her personal journey toward becoming an agent of change. Originally from Barcelona, Spain, Fernandez said her Soka education taught her that dialogue is not about “drawing differences, but finding commonalities.” She uses that as a guide at work, giving attendees examples of how the lesson of “respect” translates into concrete practices. The event closed with attendees, stimulated by the speakers’ stories, enjoying a Q&A about how each could embody global citizenship’s virtues in their own lives during this unprecedented time.", "categories": ["International Studies", "Soka at 20", "Alumni", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "October 21, 2020", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},
{"newspaper": "soka-news", "url": "https://www.soka.edu/news-events/news/not-cancelled-2020-celebrating-creativity-midst-chaos", "title": "Not Cancelled 2020: Celebrating Creativity in the Midst of Chaos", "text": "Early this year, as event after event was being called off because of the pandemic, Nina Boutin ‘17 decided she wanted to prove that some things cannot be cancelled. Boutin, a freelance artist , got in touch with Professor Oleg Gelikman and together they came up with the idea for Not Cancelled 2020 . The online art exhibit is a collaborative project where students and alumni can channel their creative energies while quarantined. Boutin, currently working remotely for the Caravan Stage Company, knew that many people were feeling the weight of the moment and were compelled to create. She wanted to identify the common threads among projects and create a space for ideas to interact. Boutin reached out to students and alumni on social media, asking them to share personal art projects. “For me, it felt like a meaningful way to create community during a weird and difficult time,” Boutin said. “Even though I was stuck at home alone, I felt I was working in solidarity with my peers.” It can be scary to share your artwork publicly and make yourself vulnerable, but many in the Soka humanities community answered the Not Cancelled 2020 call. In September, a website was published to showcase pieces by nine students and alumni, ranging from the class of 2016 to the class of 2021. Unlike the trite advertising message of “we’re stronger when we’re apart,” the Not Cancelled 2020 space doesn’t impose a false story of happiness. It documents the reality we’re living, including moments of frustration, stress, or helplessness we may feel. The exhibit shows that while the pandemic has taken so much from our lives, it has also allowed for self-reflection and growth. Jordan Lindsey ’17 , one of the featured artists, is a doctoral student in communication and culture at Howard University, currently living in Washington, D.C.. He spends his free time writing poetry and short fiction, taking photos, and making music. Since the beginning of the pandemic, he’s struggled to express the tension he feels both internally and externally. These tensions materialize in the series of illustrated prose poems Lindsey created for Not Cancelled 2020 . Each aspect of their composition—color, structure, and visual and verbal content—comes together to create a sense of space for the audience to relate to. “I think the pandemic tested my ability to convey emotions and feelings I hadn’t finished grappling with in a way that was somehow coherent and structured,” Lindsey said. “My piece was a way for me to try and think about/illustrate the tensions taking place inside and outside of myself during this time with words and visuals. Things like the irony of feeling lonely in your own home, but also enjoying the calmness from people’s absence in public spaces.” Rosabelle Heine ’20, whose founding of Soka’s first podcast and community radio club led to her job as a podcast editor and producer, created a mail art project for the exhibition. “Handle with Care” was inspired by her capstone “Secrets, Letters and Social Practice Art: Self-Presentation in the Internet Age.” “For the past several months, most of my interactions have been through a screen,” she said. “I wanted to return to the simplicity and constancy of letter-writing during a time when nothing felt simple or constant. I also wanted to escape the echo-chamber of my Instagram feed where everyone I follow and everyone who follows me is posting similarly. If I send a letter that displays a message, someone new (i.e., a USPS worker) might see it. This project was also a feeble attempt to support the US Postal Service in a period of crisis.” Many of the envelopes depict scenes related to the pandemic or our current circumstances. One shows a series of faces with tan lines from a mask, another shows people touching beneath the caption “things to look forward to.” Some letters address USPS workers, while others depict distance between friends and loved ones or the Black Lives Matter movement. The art is intended both for the recipient of the letter and the worker delivering the letter. In a time where someone’s entire day is spent looking at a screen, writing or receiving a handmade letter in the mail can create a deeper connection than an electronic message. For Heine, mail art was a way to express creativity and create community at the same time. Rina Lindenmayer ’19 , who works at a secondhand bookstore in their hometown of Gaithersburg, Maryland, created a short comic exploring their personal anxiety working full time amid quarantine precautions and a helplessness they felt regarding current issues we’re facing, including police brutality and the global pandemic. “I feel that the pandemic has caused a shared anxiety within our communities and our country, exacerbated by the many social and political issues that have been continually brought to our attention within the year,” Lindenmayer said. “I was inspired to create work that reflects this commonality of discomfort in order to remind ourselves that we are not alone.” Like Lindenmayer, Boutin felt a need to create to fill an emptiness, something she found to be both exciting and terrifying. Her watercolor paintings can be seen as meditations surrounding a novel, Chevengur, by Andrei Platonov, written in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution. She was inspired by Platonov’s vision of community and his intense care for all that have been forgotten and oppressed. As she finished the series, she realized that her work was “more about the movement of grief, the weight of loss, and the necessity of mourning loss collectively rather than individually.” With school, work, and even doctor’s visits being conducted from our homes these days, it can be hard to stay motivated, let alone be creative. Boutin’s secret? “I force myself to spend time with my art everyday, even if I don’t want to,” she said. “It’s my way of giving my art agency as well as keeping my momentum going so I never feel stuck. I find that my art grows from these moments of exhaustion and feeling like I have to give up, so if I just keep at it and wait until that moment comes, the next moment will be the creative spark.” —Nagisa Smalheiser ’21", "categories": ["Undergraduate Academics", "Humanities", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "November 02, 2020", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

At the outset of her presentation, Professor England highlighted how this project reflected the scholar-teacher model and the role of SUA students in both initiating this project and subsequently assisting in the compilation and translation of materials covering a fourteen-year period. In addition, Professor England acknowledged the support that she had received from SUA in the form of a Pacific Basin Research Center summer grant that enabled her to conduct fieldwork in Guatemala. Professor England’s analysis employs “frames”; how the problem is represented in the media, narratives of victim and perpetrator alike, patriarchy and a culture of machismo , and responsibility to address violence against women In an environment where gang-related violence is endemic and policing is ineffective or corrupt, and few cases are solved.  Investigative reporting is constrained by intimidation and/or the threat of reprisal, and newspaper accounts often victimize the victim by holding women responsible, either for the violence committed against them or for failing to report these crimes. To a certain extent, violence against women is also a legacy of the brutal civil war that gripped Guatemala for 36 years (1960-1996). This, coupled with the normalization of violence has created a culture of fear in which violence against women, though widespread, is under-reported and poorly understood.

Latines Unides is an affinity group that seeks to increase Latinx visibility on campus, raising, sharing, and organizing around issues relevant to its members. The event, during Latinx Heritage Month that runs from Sept. 15 to Oct. 15, focused on identity, and terms such as Latino/a, Latinx, Latin@, and Latine that reflect the wide range of diversity found across Latin American countries, histories, racial makeup, and cultures. Part of the discussion was dedicated to unpacking these labels, their complexities, and the panelists’ journeys in discovering which terms reflect their identities the best. Panelists included a mix of SUA students, faculty, and staff—Cindy Chavez ’23; Miki Prunty ’23; Pablo Camus-Oyarzun, assistant professor of Spanish language and culture; Ana Palomar, adjunct Spanish instructor; and Astrid Dorantes, assistant director of the Office of International Student Services. “The event was meaningful for those of us who identify as Latinx,” said Daniela Soto ’21, one of the facilitators, “but we also believe it was a great space for others who do not identify as part of these groups to learn more about them.” Said Cindy Chavez: “You cannot assume people’s comfortableness with the word Latinx or any other label. In order to grasp what Latinx identity is, just talk to a friend, ask them what their hometown is and what their experience growing up ‘Latinx’ was like.” —by Nagisa Smalheiser ‘21", "categories": ["Student Life", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "October 05, 2020", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

{"newspaper": "soka-news", "url": "https://www.soka.edu/news-events/news/soka-hosts-first-seed-business-symposium", "title": "Soka Hosts First SEED Business Symposium", "text": "Soka University launched its first Social Enterprise & Economic Development (SEED) Business Symposium on Friday, November 30, 2018, featuring high-level leaders and speakers from innovative companies around the country. The SEED symposium was sponsored by the Office of Academic Affairs and Bridges to Business (B2B), a coaching and mentorship program helping students connect their education into the business sector. The forum engaged business founders, social entrepreneurs, corporate leaders, philanthropists, educators, and students, with the intention to inspire awareness and promote discussion about how social enterprise, conscious business, nonprofits, and public-private-educational partnerships can work together to create healthier economic ecosystems. Vice President of Academic Affairs Ed Feasel and Soka B2B Director Mary Patrick Kavanaugh welcomed more than 90 participants to Founders Hall. Guests included members of the Soka community, local business leaders, educators, and local high school students from Santa Ana and Fountain Valley. Dr. Feasel opened the program by sharing his enthusiasm of how economics and business can influence social impact and innovation, as well as how the Soka mission of value creation also has important applications in the business community. The day started with Neetal Parekh, CEO of Innov8social, giving an overview of the social enterprise sector with her talk, “The New Bottom Line: Business Models of Social Impact.” Parekh, a licensed attorney, with expertise in digital strategy, storytelling, and communications, discussed how her career trajectory ultimately led her to parlay her legal career into one focused on advising leaders interested in business models that focus on positive social impacts, such as Benefit Corporations and B Corps. Named as EY’s 2018 Social Entrepreneur of the Year in Orange County, Melissa Beck, president of Anonymous Philanthropy, discussed “Re-inventing the Non-Profit & Social Sector,” by outlining how she applies cutting edge for-profit business strategies to the nonprofit structure. Beck shared how a personal epiphany led her to commit her career to work in the nonprofit sector. Realizing they had to be concerned with two bottom lines and are mandated with changing chronic and systemic inequities; she felt nonprofits should have access to the most talented workers and ample resources. In her nearly six years with Big Brothers Big Sisters (more than five years as CEO) she grew revenue more than 300% and the organization was named a top place to work by the Orange County Business Journal (one of only two nonprofits given that distinction). Beck now serves as president of Anonymous Philanthropy where she helps philanthropists create proactive and strategic ways to amplify their giving and achieve maximum social impact. Mike Hannigan, president and co-founder of Give Something Back, a certified B Corp, presented “Activist to Entrepreneur: Rise of the Socially Responsible Business.” A successful business leader with a drive to provide greater community resources, Hannigan applied his passion for activism to business and created a competitive national office supply company that gives a portion of profits back to the buying community by funding local non-profit organizations. “Entrepreneurship: Why Risk It All for a Dream,” was the topic for lunch keynote speaker Gail Becker, who shared the pains and passions of a newly minted entrepreneur. As founder and CEO of Caulipower, a breakout frozen pizza company that produces healthy options in the gluten-free frozen food category, Becker shared how the death of him immigrant, entrepreneurial father, inspired her to leave her high-level and lucrative position as a partner at a global public relations firm to risk going into business. With two small children at home dealing with celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder which doesn’t allow the body to process gluten, Becker took the small inheritance left by her father and launched Caulipower Pizza. The road to success was not easy (“sometimes I would cry three times a day”) but her new product offers nutritious, tasty food for the gluten intolerant, and is now ranked among the best-selling frozen pizzas. Additionally, as part of her business model, the company donates a percentage of profits to an organization that fights against childhood obesity. The afternoon consisted of three vibrant panel sessions. First, husband and wife team Rick and Nancy Holiday—moderated by Soka fourth-year Emmanuel Gebremeskel—discussed how their innovative housing manufacturing firm, Factory O_S, is bringing transformational change to a stagnant construction industry by building well-designed, tech-ready multifamily homes 40% faster and 20% less expensive than conventional housing. They explained how the savings are proven, not projected, and are accomplished by building the bulk of the homes off-site inside a large factory, with union labor, right down to the toilet paper holders. They then ship the modular homes and assemble them on-site, making them more affordable and efficient than traditional construction. Three thought-leaders in the corporate sustainability sector then tackled the topic of how to set standards and create blueprints for more responsible consumerism. Jaime Nack, sustainability advisor for Three Squares Inc. and founder of the Women in Green Forum, moderated a discussion with Kimberly Matsoukas, senior manager of sustainability and social responsibility at Vans, and Faith Taylor, professor of corporate social responsibility at Feliciano School of Business at Montclair State University. The final panel, moderated by Ed Feasel, examined the relationship between the Seminar Network, a group of like-minded philanthropists interested in social enterprise founded by Charles Koch; Stand Together, a funding organization that identifies strategic partnerships for the Seminar Network; and Chrysalis, a local social enterprise that successfully helps the unemployed and at-risk get jobs funded by the Seminar Network and Stand Together. Speakers included Will Moyer from the Seminar Network, Sam Leyvas from Stand Together, and Mark Loranger from Chrysalis. This panel generated animated audience Q&A and plans to continue the conversation in future SEED or related forums. Considered a vibrant and engaging information exchange, tentative plans for future SEED conferences are in the planning stages.

Learning Cluster faculty reflect on their transformative academic and travel experiences. Indigenous Development in Malaysia: Economics, Ecology & Politics | Shane Barter With the kind support of the Nieves Family Foundation, our learning cluster sought to better understand indigenous peoples in Asia. The idea of indigeneity has been shaped by the experiences of first peoples in “settler countries.” In recent decades, the concept has become increasingly important in Africa and Asia, where groups formerly seen as ethnic minorities frame their struggles in terms of being indigenous peoples. Our course sought to understand how the concept is understood in Asia, specifically Malaysia, and how indigenous peoples have approached contemporary challenges associated with development. After one week of intensive classes, we traveled to Sabah, in Malaysian Borneo, for 12 days. We met with government officials, NGOs, university classes, artists, business people, political parties, and more. Our numerous meetings helped us to better understand the divisions within Sabah’s indigenous communities, the complex landscape of indigeneity, and the major concerns related to migration, land rights, palm oil, and tourism. We learned so much in the classroom and in the field, and had fun doing so along the way. The students did a wonderful job in helping make for a meaningful, memorable class! Social Enterprises and Economic Development II: Hong Kong & Shenzhen | Junyi Liu What is economic development in the case of China, the largest developing country that astonishes the world by the highest average growth rate in the past four decades? Entering the new era of the development, have Chinese firms started or continued to take corporate social responsibility seriously in making their management decisions? To explore those two questions, we visited nine firms and three universities in Shenzhen (SZ), Hong Kong (HK), and Macau (MU), China over eight days in January 2019. The tour of Hengli Digital Inc. in SZ, a city that is nicknamed “silicon valley of China,” presented us the whole process of producing a cable box from naked motherboard to a completed cable box that is packaged and ready to be shipped to the customers in Europe. Experiencing three other firms in SZ (office supplies, garment, and product testing lab) in the same fashion, we have a better understanding of the term “Made in China” as it has become alive to us. Green Monday, a vegetarian restaurant chain store in HK which strives to promote a healthy diet, shared with us their mission impossible as polls show most HK people are meat-lovers, and yet they managed to survive and thrive. Meyer Corporation, the second-largest cookware maker in the world, sent out three teams coming from various of departments to showcase their company head to toe, for which we are grateful and became knowledgeable in the field of cookware. Lok Kwan social service center in HK witnessed the fun time our students had with the staff and underprivileged children they served through games initiated by our own talented and caring SUA students. Fair employment agency, a representative of social enterprise in HK that serves foreign domestic workers, surprised us by a new and effective business model that has reshaped the very industry. Last but not least, Lingnan University (the only liberal arts university in HK), Hang Seng University (the second largest private university in HK), and University of Macau (the largest public university in MU) hosted us with high hospitality by setting up meetings with their service-learning center staff, students, and even government officials. We are in the process of establishing some formal or informal relationships with some or even all of those universities thanks to the trip. The Politics of Asylum in Miami | Sarah England In January 2019 the Learning Cluster “Asylum in Miami” traveled to Miami to meet with professors from Florida International University, reporters from the Miami Herald and El Nuevo Herald , as well as immigrant advocacy groups to learn about the history and current situation of Latin American asylum seekers arriving in Miami. We learned that the history of Latin American immigration and asylum began in the 1960s when Cubans began to flee the Castro regime, continued with Haitians arriving in the 1970s and 1980s fleeing the Duvalier regime, and later Nicaraguans seeking asylum after the success of the Sandinista revolution. Today there are also many people from Honduras and El Salvador, Colombia, and most recently Venezuelans leaving their countries to escape from terrible economic and political turmoil. While this influx of Latin Americans has made Miami one of the most Latino cities in the US (at about 70% of the population of Miami), we also learned that they are very divided politically and socially. In part this has to do with the types of regimes they were fleeing (communist vs. US-backed military dictatorships), the social classes they were coming from (elites vs. the very poor), and their racial identities (those who identify as white vs. black or Afro-Latino). It is also related to the evolution of asylum law in the US which has gone from being relatively open to very closed which is having an extremely detrimental effect on more recent arrivals from Central America and even some of the older immigrant groups who are ending up in detention and deportation proceedings. We learned a great deal about the situation of Venezuelans who are the largest group applying for asylum right now but it is unclear whether they will be successful given the anti-immigrant and anti-refugee climate of the current administration. In all, we were able to visit many of the ethnic neighborhoods, speak with immigrants and activists about their experiences, and try many wonderful cuisines.

Students experienced what it means to be global citizens, tackling various issues by bridging theory and practice together and formulating educated and constructive responses or actions to these issues. Sponsored by Academic Affairs, the event was held on Wednesday, January 30, from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. in the SUA dining hall and front patio. This year’s Coordinator of the 2019 Learning Clusters and Professor of Psychology Seiji Takaku opened the four-hour Learning Cluster Fair and thanked the Learning Cluster faculty, students, and staff for their participation and the vital support from the Luis and Linda Nieves Family Foundation. Mr. Nieves and his daughter also made a special visit to explore the LC Fair this year and stopped at each table to visit with students about hear about what they learned during their learning clusters. Learning cluster students displayed their research findings and perspectives sharing their concerns on regional, national, and international issues with the greater community of SUA. Human rights, including children’s rights, ethnic and gender identity, peace, justice, conservation, science, and economics, were central exhibit themes featured in vibrant poster displays and sophisticated computer-based presentations and films, as well as a live theatrical production focusing on the lives of migrants seeking political asylum. Below are summaries of the 2019 Learning Clusters: The Culture of Peace | Ambassador Anwarul K. Chowdhury, Distinguished Visiting Scholar For Ambassador Chowdhury’s ninth year teaching his Culture of Peace learning cluster, his class presented an inspiring and educational table. The class studied the historical background and conceptual context of the culture of peace and its evolution within the United Nations system and the focus on women, children, peace and human security. The cluster’s table featured student-created, informative, and well-designed posters reflecting the class curriculum including sustainable development goals and eight action areas to promote a culture of peace. Basic Science Laboratory Skills | Zahra Afrasiabi, Associate Professor of Chemistry Science laboratories can be very complex and a little intimidating. In this learning cluster, we had a chance to help students learn basic laboratory skills and build their confidence by teaching how to apply different techniques for routine lab work. Students prepared several skincare products from natural ingredients in the lab, which provided an opportunity for them to practically use the theoretical knowledge gained in the course. It helped the students to investigative various skills and eventually apply them to a specific problem. The Politics of Disneyland | Peter Burns, Professor of Political Science The learning cluster table on the topic of the Politics of Disneyland, taught by Professor Peter Burns, presented to the audience the idea of Disneyland park being an agent of political socialization, creating certain images and ideas that were imprinted within once perception of American political culture and American history. The table presented two posters with photos taken at the park representing ideas of patriotism, and cooperation with big corporations. The group also presented a short video clip, about different representations of American politics and history within the park. The video was centered around two most patriotic attractions at Disneyland, the “Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln” and the “Flag Retreat Ceremony.” Students at the table were eager to answer the questions of the audience and share their findings of the distorted, culturally erased, and white-centered representation of the US at Disneyland.​ Contributed by Arslan Kasimov, SUA student Introduction to Geographic Information Systems | Monika Calef, Associate Professor of Physical Geography In the Introduction to Geographic Information Systems learning cluster, students learned about performing spatial analyses using ArcGIS Pro by ESRI. For their final project, students got to create a map on a topic of their choice; this meant they had to find the data on their topic, convert it to make it match, and then create a meaningful and legible map. Spanish in California | Pablo Camus-Oyarzun, Assistant Professor of Spanish Language and Culture In this learning cluster, students explored the relationship between language, culture, and space in Southern California. The group traveled to San Diego, Santa Ana, and Los Angeles where they interviewed bilingual high school students and explored the linguistic landscape of the Latino neighborhoods. Marine and Coastal Citizen Science | Lisa Crummett, Assistant Professor of Biology In the Marine and Coastal Citizen Science learning cluster, teams of three students showcased what they did for their final project with PowerPoint slides documenting their findings. Each student tackled a different issue related to human impacts on ocean environments that are either currently being addressed or could be addressed with citizen science. Each project involved data analysis, often data collected by citizen scientists, and a thoughtful conclusion based on that analysis. This LC also featured a photo-slide show on a TV screen that exhibited our many field trips including whale and dolphin cruise observations, a citizen science cruise, and multiple tide pool bioblitzes. Radical Media and Democratization | Tomas Crowder-Taraborrelli, Visiting Assistant Professor of Latin American Studies The topic of our learning cluster was Radical Media and Democratization. Our multimedia Learning Cluster Fair presentation reflected the research that went into our field trip to the Bay Area to explore independent media outlets. Students created a Facebook page for their Soka radio work. They also covered the Women’s March in Los Angeles, which occurred during our LC. In the Bay Area, students visited TV stations and radio stations including KQED, KALX, and Mutiny Radio. Our LC fair booth included photographs and excerpts of interviews with the documentary filmmaker James LeBrecht.​ Death, Dying, and Beyond | Danielle Denardo, Assistant Professor of Sociology The table for the Death, Dying, and Beyond learning cluster course displayed posters that the students created as part of a research project for the course. The students also used the table to thematically display information and pictures from our field trips (Museum of Death, Kali Mandir temple, mortuary, and cemetery) and guest speakers (county coroner, hospice nurse, spiritualist historian, and grief counselor). Garbology: Managing Waste at SUA | Robert Hamersley, Associate Professor of Microbiology Professor Hamersley and his students presented the results of their Learning Cluster entitled Garbology: Managing Waste at SUA. Students conducted waste audits: actual measurements of what is being thrown away at SUA. They found that waste was dominated by disposable coffee cups, paper towels and napkins, and disposable drink bottles. They also found that trash bins contained more than 35% recyclable materials, and that the recycling bins contained more than 25% trash. However, they also found out that SUA only recycles paper that is disposed of in special paper recycling bins and cardboard boxes, and that all other recycling bins are being disposed of as trash. At least part of the problem is that the recycling bins are so heavily contaminated with trash. If the University is to increase the amount of waste diverted from landfills, we need to find ways to use less disposable paper and plastic products, and to educate students, staff, and faculty to sort their trash and recycling correctly. English-Japanese Translation | Osamu Ishiyama, Associate Professor of Japanese Language and Culture In this learning cluster, students got hands-on experience on translation between English and Japanese through various group projects and frequent in-class presentations. Projects they worked on include a novel by Dazai Osamu, a reality TV show, films, and anime. This class also featured two guest speakers. Dr. Tomoko Takahashi gave a fascinating lecture on self-translation based on her books and research. The class also had a chance to speak with Masako Fukutani (SUA class of 2017) who is currently completing her master’s degree in translation/interpretation at Middlebury Institute for International Studies at Monterey. The Group Dynamics & Contemporary Society | Jennifer Lee, Visiting Assistant Professor of Psychology The Group Dynamics & Contemporary Society learning cluster offered students an opportunity to develop an in-depth understanding of group dynamics from a systemic perspective and to study their own behaviors in groups. Throughout the course, students examined theories of group development, power and authority, leadership and obedience, dynamics between and among groups, and the interplay of sociocultural identities and group dynamics. For the Learning Cluster Fair, students created several posters that showcased their final research projects on decision-making in groups, terrorism and groupthink, and racial discrimination in the US education system. Visitors at the fair were invited to participate in a student-led experiential exercise designed to demonstrate the impact of positive and negative feedback on group performance.​ Exploring Death and Life Through Film | Xiaoxing Liu, Professor of Chinese Language and Culture After intensively talking about death, all of the students have expressed a passionate and thoughtful outlook of life and emphasized the significance of “seize the day.” They developed sincere respect and appreciation for the people who take care of deceased human beings. Students took major responsibilities in teaching this LC by summarizing the readings, selecting certain films, and organizing classroom activities. The final projects showing at the LC Fair indicate their growth and maturity. Women, Peace, and Security | Lisa MacLeod, Associate Professor of International Studies The Women, Peace and Security learning cluster provided students with an opportunity to learn about sexual violence in armed conflict. The cluster’s contribution to the learning cluster fair consisted of four posters. One poster explored the challenges faced by children born of wartime rape. A second examined efforts by women in Bosnia to seek justice and hold perpetrators accountable for their crimes. A third poster examined efforts to end impunity for sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. A fourth focused on issues related to sexual violence during and after armed conflict in Liberia. Water Problems | Anthony Mazeroll, Professor of Biology The students presented their findings on the issues dealing with water quality in the Salton Sea (the largest lake in California). The lake is located south of Palms Springs in the Imperial and Coachella valleys. The lake receives its water from agricultural runoff and untreated sewage water from Baja California, thus the water quality is poor. Salton Sea is now drying up due to the fact that it is receiving less water from ag sources. This is causing health problems from the toxic dust that is kick up from the dried sea. Refugee Resettlement in California | Tetsushi Ogata, Visiting Professor of Peace and Conflict Studies The learning cluster on Refugee Resettlement in California organized field trips to visit 11 civil society organizations working in refugee and asylee issues in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Orange County. At one stop, students went to 1951 Coffee Company (which took its name from the 1951 Refugee Convention) in Berkeley, where all the baristas are refugees or asylees. During the LC Fair, students showcased their research based on the stories they had heard during the field trips, analyzing the effectiveness of refugee resettlement process, the role of Islamophobia and its impact on Muslim refugees today, discrimination against LGBT refugees, and stereotypes and (mis)perceptions associated with the notion of refugees. A group of students also performed a play, So We Ran . Arts and Poverty | Nalini Rao, Associate Professor of World Art The learning cluster offered by Nalini Rao was on Arts and Poverty in which students examined works of painting, sculpture, photography in two museums that portrayed poverty and its social effects. By analyzing those works and relating it to what they witnessed in the homeless shelters, students worked on team projects that could inspire others to feel for the poor. These included musical compositions and artworks that were moving, insightful, and creative. Brazil’s Great Disaster and Possible Redemption | Ian Read, Associate Professor of Latin American Studies The students of the learning cluster Brazil’s Great Disaster began with this question: What caused the worst natural calamity in the Americas in the last 300 years and why has it been mostly forgotten? The students spent the first two days designing a rigorous syllabus. Following two weeks of lecture, discussion, presentations, essays, and finally a visit to the UCLA research library, students began to turn their attention to how a new disaster (e.g., drought, famine, and disease) is likely to occur in the same place today. Drought is cyclical in northeastern Brazil and potentially exacerbated by climate change. Stereotypes: Mexicans in the National US Imaginary | Veronica Quezada, Assistant Professor of Spanish Language and Culture Through scholarly texts, articles, documentaries/ films, and first-person accounts, Stereotypes: Mexicans in the National US Imaginary studied Mexico-US relations and the wave of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination the Mexican community has experienced and continues to experience in the United States. First, students analyzed in detail historical milestones to illustrate the presence and active involvement of the Mexican community in the United States: The US-Mexico War, the Bracero Program, the participation of Mexican Americans in national defense and wars, and the civil rights movement of the 60s. Then, they investigated the current situation of the Mexican and Chicano communities in the social and political spheres of the United States; as well as Mexico’s own incurrence of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination, especially in Tijuana (Mexico-US border) with Central American migrants. Studying Mexican and Chicano history and identity on a cultural and humanistic level helped the ultimate purpose of the LC: to deepen students’ understanding of concepts which are socially constructed and end up in the stigmatization of certain groups in the National imaginary, and to identify and promote constructive inter-group relations.​ The Art of Filming Live Theater | Sandrine Siméon, Assistant Professor of French Language and Culture This learning cluster explored the art and implications of filming theater. Students attended a broadcast from London’s National Theater, visited a recording studio, and staged a short play filmed with the help of a professional crew. Students reported that the course boosted their public-speaking confidence, strengthened their collaborative work skills, and that learning about an interdisciplinary/alternative object of study fostered creative thinking, new meanings, and ideas. Further, experiential and field learning helped them cultivate unique investigative abilities and kinesthetic modes of learning.​", "categories": ["Undergraduate Academics"], "date_publish": "January 30, 2019", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

The workshops for new faculty included a welcome from the Dean of Faculty, Bryan Penprase, and a discussion about teaching at SUA and syllabus design with the Faculty Enhancement Committee, chaired by Peter Burns, and including Zahra Afrasiabi, Monika Calef, and Oleg Gelikman. The new faculty were also given briefings by Andrew Woolsey, Dean of Enrollment Services and Hyon Moon, Dean of Students, who together provided an overview of the characteristics and unique aspects of our SUA students.  The day also included an Advising Workshop and a welcoming lunch for the entire faculty with introductions to faculty joining SUA this year.  These new faculty include Sandrine Simeon, Assistant Professor of French Language and Culture, and Danielle Denardo, Assistant Professor of Sociology. Laureen Hom, our incoming PBRC postdoctoral scholar, and instructor was also introduced. dozen large tables set up for the occasion. After a welcome from the Dean of Faculty, Bryan Penprase, students and faculty quickly began their discussions as they enjoyed a buffet dinner together. Dinner discussions ranged across all topics and included a chance for students to share some of their impressions and revelations from their Core I course, as well as a chance to get to know each other and faculty members better. After the dinner discussion, faculty were asked to introduce themselves briefly, and each faculty member stood up and provided a short overview of their research and some of their favorite classes. The diversity of the faculty’s intellectual interests was dazzling, and the incoming students were able to begin to appreciate both the breadth of scholarly interests within the SUA faculty and the strong and sincere interests the faculty have in meeting SUA students who might share some of these interests. As always happens at this event, a number of students were able to connect with these faculty members after the introductions and across the PAC lobby groups of students and faculty were in rapt discussion long after the dinner event ended.  Our incoming students at SUA had a wonderful beginning to their academic journey, and the faculty and students together look forward to a great new academic year. The same evening featured the return of an SUA annual tradition, the Welcoming Dinner for Incoming Students, where our SUA faculty personally welcome our students to campus. Our incoming class, which includes 111 students from 16 nations and 23 states, represents a wonderful diversity of energy and talent and the faculty enjoyed greeting them as they begin their first full semester at SUA. This year the dinner was held at the Performing Arts Center lobby, and the students and over 35 faculty enjoyed a lively meal and conversation.", "categories": ["Academics", "Undergraduate Academics"], "date_publish": "September 01, 2018", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Tickets are on sale now and may be purchased online or by calling 949‑480‑4ART (4278). In 1981, more than 500,000 music fans gathered in Central Park to witness the now legendary reunion of folk due to Simon & Garfunkel. With dulcet vocals harmonizing over a lilting guitar, artists Lee Lessack and Johnny Rodgers bring back that incredible show. Lessack’s graceful lyric baritone vocals and Rodgers’s internationally-celebrated musical ability bring back all the beloved poetic masterpieces of Simon & Garfunkel, including “Mrs. Robinson,” “Bridge Over Troubled Waters,” and “The Sound of Silence.” A Philadelphia native, Lee Lessack ’s sophisticated yet endearing persona has made him a shining star of the international concert scene. Billboard magazine calls his singing “Cabaret romanticism of a high order.” Touring extensively in the United States and Europe to sold-out performances and releasing five albums, Lessack has proven himself both as performer and recording artist. Johnny Rodgers is a pianist, music ambassador, Broadway star, and recording artist who is described by Stephen Holden (of the New York Times ) as an entertainer “who has show business in his bones” with “fused elements of Billy Joel, Peter Allen, and Johnny Mercer.” Rodgers began his career in Chicago and has since traveled the country and the world making music with acclaimed artists as well as locals of villages across the Middle East and Southeast Asia. ### Soka Performing Arts Center is located at 1 University Drive, Aliso Viejo on the campus of Soka University of America.

About Ensemble Galilei Founded in 1990, Ensemble Galilei is an ensemble of players from both classical and Celtic backgrounds, playing Irish and Scottish airs and dance tunes, early and medieval music, and original compositions. The Ensemble takes their name and inspiration from the life of composer Vincenzo Galilei, whose influence, some four hundred years ago, helped restore a vital element of passion to the music of the day. To achieve their unique Celtic sound, Ensemble Galilei has melded the elegance of chamber music with the energy and excitement of traditional music. An intricate blend of instruments grants listeners passage to another world, evoking musical images of the ancient Celts and bringing these images to life for today’s audiences.

Ira Helfand, MD is co-president of the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW), recipient of the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize, and he is co-founder and past president of Physicians for Social Responsibility, IPPNW’s US affiliate. Dr. Helfand was educated at Harvard College and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. He is a former chairman of the Department of Emergency Medicine and president of the Medical Staff at Cooley Dickinson Hospital and currently practices as an internist and urgent care physician at Family Care Medical Center in Springfield, Massachusetts. Dr. Helfand represents IPPNW at the annual World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates. He is also a member of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN)’s International Steering Committee. Dr. Helfand co-authored PSR’s report, Nuclear Famine: 2 Billion at Risk? , which outlines the global health consequences of regional nuclear war. Dr. Helfand addressed national delegations at international conferences on the Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons in Oslo, Norway; Nayarit, Mexico; and Vienna, Austria during the May 2016 U.N. Open-Ended Working Group on disarmament in Geneva, and throughout the U.N. General Assembly negotiations in 2017. Introduced by Dean of Faculty, Bryan Penprase, Dr. Helfand offered his thoughts on the threat of nuclear weapons, stating that the use of nuclear weapons is a greater threat today than it was during the Cold War.  Helfand presented seven specific geopolitical flashpoints that contribute to the increased danger of nuclear war.  The first five flashpoints describe the unpredictable and unstable relations between the US and Russia; US and China; US and Korea; tensions in South Asia between India and Pakistan; and last, US and Iran relations. Each of these countries possesses significant amounts of nuclear weapons and each escalation of the conflict only brings these parties closer to nuclear action. Helfand further explained three additional factors that should be considered which add to the risk. These are; climate change, the threat of cyber-terrorism and, the Trump presidency. Climate change is already a concern for sustainable life, but when we begin to see mass migrations of people into other territories, due to uninhabitable land in addition to mass food shortages, tensions only increase into greater conflict.  Cyber-terrorism is also a very real threat, where hackers could gain access to the command and control centers and actually launch or falsely appear to launch a weapon, making the target country believe they are under nuclear attack. Helfand also describes the Trump presidency as a contributing factor.  It is an assumption that decisions about nuclear policies are made by leaders who are wise, temperate and well-informed but members of Trump’s own cabinet feel that this president is not able to handle access to nuclear codes or able to make decisions surrounding the use of nuclear weapons. Helfand concluded his talk by discussing the mass destruction of an actual nuclear attack on a large city such as Los Angeles.  The effects of this initial devastation would alter modern civilization, as we know it.  He pressed how we are living on borrowed time if we continue to build and keep nuclear weapons.  This is a real danger as long as these weapons exist.  It is time to take action and get our government to commit to abolishing these weapons.  Despite the doom he illustrated, Helfand offered that while this problem is a burden on younger generations, it is also a gift, a gift to continue to fight for change in our nation’s policies and live a truly contributive life.", "categories": ["Academics"], "date_publish": "October 01, 2018", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Tickets are $40 for adults; $32 for students, seniors, and active military families; and $29 each for groups of 10 or more. Purchase tickets online or by calling 949-480-4ART (4278). The New York Times describes Jones as “a trumpeter with an incisive tone and a firm grasp of jazz traditions” and JazzTimes writes, “When Jones solos, soaring with a gentle strength as his band swells behind him, it’s not just a pretty melody … it’s praise.” Jones will be joined by pianist Alex Brown , bassist Corcoran Holt , and drummer Quincy Phillips . A highly respected and in-demand musician, Jones has been prominently featured with a number of artists, recording and/or performing with many major figures, including Illinois Jacquet, Jimmy Heath, Frank Foster, Nancy Wilson, Dianne Reeves, Gerald Wilson, and Marcus Miller. The relationship with Miller led to another highly impacting experience when Jones was selected by Miller, Herbie Hancock, and Wayne Shorter for their Tribute to Miles tour in 2011. Prior to that, he performed with Wynton Marsalis and the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, participating in two recordings. Jones recently joined the Berklee College of Music’s distinguished faculty as the Chair of the Brass Department. He also serves as Artistic Director of both the Pittsburgh and Cleveland jazz orchestras and is working toward organizing the various jazz orchestras all over the country. He is the current artist-in-residence at San Francisco Performances and is a member of the SF Jazz Collective. Music and spirituality have always intertwined in the artistic vision of the trumpeter, composer, educator, and activist. As a child, he performed with the church choir in his hometown and switched from the drums to the trumpet upon his first exposure to Miles Davis at age ten. Twenty-five years later, he still reveres Davis, “Miles is probably the single most powerful influence on me as an artist. His overall vision, the way he changed with the times, the purity of his sound.”", "categories": ["Performing Arts Center"], "date_publish": "March 07, 2018", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Purchase tickets online or by calling 949-480-4ART (4278). The music of the late, beloved singer-songwriter John Denver is like an old friend, outlasting trends and standing the test of time, teaching us to care for the earth and care for each other. Acclaimed performer Jim Curry’s uncanny ability to mirror Denver’s voice and clean-cut look takes you back to the time when “Rocky Mountain High,” “Sunshine,” “Calypso,” and “Annie’s Song” topped the charts. Curry will be performing with band members Anne Curry , Diane Ireland , Thomas Williams , Gene Wagner , and Jeff Lantz . Curry is not your usual “Vegas-style” impersonator. In fact, he is not an impersonator at all. Curry sings, in his own natural voice, a tribute to the music in a way that has to be seen and heard to understand the pure honesty of his amazing performance. His looks and his voice are simply a pleasant coincidence that captures the true essence of Denver’s music. Whether Curry is performing with a symphony orchestra, with his talented band, or by himself, his compelling voice combined with dramatic images of nature creates an unforgettable show that will fill up your senses. Curry began his music career writing and performing the song “The Time of Your Life” for his senior play. The song was then voted to be the 1975 class song and Curry was awarded a Rotary Scholarship to study music in college. Even at this early stage in his life, Curry’s natural voice resembled that of Denver. Embracing the similarities, Curry continued to sing and specialize in Denver’s music, and share his positive messages of love, humanity, and environmental awareness. Denver’s untimely death in 1997 was a tragedy that was felt the world over; such a void in the musical world left Denver’s ardent fans demanding that his music survive. CBS television responded by producing a made-for-TV movie, Take Me Home, the John Denver Story , in which Curry performed an off-camera role singing as Denver. This experience inspired Curry to produce full-length Denver tribute concerts.", "categories": ["Performing Arts Center"], "date_publish": "March 09, 2018", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

The program also includes Glass’ Symphony No. 3 and Bach’s Keyboard Concerto in G Minor and the Brandenburg Concerto No. 3. Founded in 2007, the Grammy-nominated string orchestra A Far Cry has developed a distinct approach to music-making, with playing and programming that encourage risk-taking and exploration for both and audience. They have collaborated with artists such as Yo-Yo Ma, Roomful of Teeth, Silk Road Ensemble, Vijay Iyer, and David Krakauer.

{"newspaper": "soka-news", "url": "https://www.soka.edu/news-events/news/globalizing-liberal-arts", "title": "Globalizing the Liberal Arts", "text": "Soka University of America hosted a conference on Globalizing the Liberal Arts (GLA) from June 3-5, 2018. The meeting was co-organized by leaders from Yale University, Pomona College, Carleton College, Middlebury College and Soka University of America. The meeting brought together a group of 80 academic leaders from 44 liberal arts colleges and programs in 12 countries to engage in an intense working discussion about globalization of the liberal arts. The conference was attended by 14 Soka University faculty and staff, representing all of the SUA concentrations and international programs, as well as the SUA administration. International representatives from liberal arts programs in Japan, Singapore, China, Malaysia, Denmark, India, Mexico, Netherlands, Kenya, and Switzerland made the conference truly global in nature. Sharing case study examples through panel presentations, and engaging in-depth working group discussions, the participants explored the ways in which liberal arts can provide undergraduates with the capability to collaborate on complex problems that span diverse cultural perspectives. From the meeting emerged a stronger awareness of the importance of liberal education to help students respond to urgent social, political and scientific challenges that are global in their scope. The opening banquet at Founders Hall was followed by a discussion led by Claremont McKenna College President Hiram Chodosh on the future of learning and globalized liberal arts. The first morning was opened by Ed Feasel, VPAA, who welcomed the attendees to SUA, and by Bryan Penprase, Dean of Faculty, who gave an overview of the conference.  Patti McGill Peterson from ACE opened the morning with a plenary talk that discussed “Globally Engaged Institutions” and presented data to document the progression of international programs in US higher education over the past decade.  Each morning, the GLA conference included a plenary talk, followed by three panel discussions which addressed a key theme facing globalizing liberal arts with afternoon working groups studying each topic in more depth. The first set of panel discussions included panel presentations globalized Core and GE curriculum from a variety of institutions, the role of Centers for Global Learning on liberal arts campuses, and discussions on how to maximize the benefits of study abroad experiences. The first day included a presentation by Bryan Penprase about the SUA Core and GE curriculum, along with comparisons from Yale-NUS College, DKU (China) and Quest University (Canada). The final day of the conference began with a plenary keynote talk by Denison University President Adam Weinberg, who laid out a series of principles to develop globally oriented liberal arts programs that help students to master complex problems that span diverse cultural perspectives. Dr. Weinberg pointed out that liberal arts colleges can be “big” by avoiding an insular and narrow focus and through their work advancing the fundamental mission of liberal learning. Panel presentations on the final day discussed the meaning of a “global college,” how to “capture” international experience through reflection and e-portfolios, and presentations on globalized STEM education. At the end of the meeting, a plenary discussion examined some next steps and some key findings. The attendees all looked forward to further meetings to build upon the very strong presentations and conversations at the SUA conference.  The GLA discussions produced many findings and takeaways, including an interest in bringing efforts to enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion together with globalization. The conference demonstrated how new technologies such as videoconferencing can vastly strengthen globalization on our campuses.  The conference also showed how small liberal arts colleges like SUA can help the growth of small elite liberal arts schools internationally, and how together these institutions can have a strong impact on broader discussions about higher education. The working groups recommended globalization strategies that involve a systematic effort to infuse all aspects of campus with global perspectives – both in the curriculum and co-curriculum. Thankfully SUA with its strong emphasis on global citizenship is already far along in this process and further dialogue with these leading liberal arts colleges and universities should enable SUA to become even more effective in its mission of fostering global citizenship.", "categories": ["Academics"], "date_publish": "June 01, 2018", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Purchase tickets online or by calling 949-480-4ART (4278). Drawing from jazz and bluegrass, carrying a contemporary beat, the sound is deep-rooted flung-into-the-future folk. Dana Louise and the Glorious Birds work to leave their audiences glowing with the magic music can bring: genuine human connection. The Glorious Birds consists of Adams Collins (vibraphone and five-string banjo), Ezra Idlet (of Trout Fishing in America, guitar), and Keith Grimwood (of Trout Fishing in America, percussion and bass). Hailing from Costa Mesa, Purple Mountains Majesties will perform an opening act of indie retro pop. During a solo journey to the Azores Islands in 2011, Dana Louise , a visual artist, taught herself to play guitar. The daughter of Ezra Idlet of the Grammy-nominated Trout Fishing in America, Louise forged the beginnings of her sound, practicing amidst the archipelago’s lava rocks and dragon trees. Back in the States, she began singing and songwriting professionally, touring regionally and internationally, and is currently touring her debut album with Trout Records. In a very short time, she has developed a complex lyrical style that is emotionally potent and threaded with visual imagery and her vocals are at once forceful and softly genuine Trout Fishing in America , the Grammy-nominated duo comprised of Idlet and Grimwood, has been writing songs and performing together for almost forty years. In that time they have toured the United States, Europe, and Canada. When Trout was expanding its record company with the focus on emerging songwriters, Dana Louise and the Glorious Birds seemed like a natural fit for the label. In the course of producing the album, Dana Louise and the Glorious Birds , Grimwood and Idlet found themselves recording with the band. Purple Mountains Majesties is comprised of a bassist, a drummer, and four front men who switch off on a variety of instruments—all types of guitar, ukulele, keys, glockenspiel, flute, melodica, recorder, and assorted percussion. Their three- and four-part harmonies and melodies bring to mind the sound of early Beach Boys and Beatles, but their inventive instrumentation and arrangements put them firmly at the forefront of the modern alternative scene.

{"newspaper": "soka-news", "url": "https://www.soka.edu/news-events/news/supporting-soka-mission", "title": "A Short Course in Sokanomics: Managing Finances to Support the University's Mission", "text": "The pandemic has sent a shock through higher education. Campuses are quiet, enrollments are down, and most schools expect to see less support from donors this year. The American Council of Education estimates the financial impact on higher education to exceed $120 billion. It’s a highly challenging time, and an ideal moment to look at how SUA’s mission-driven and atypical approach to financing the education it offers—let’s call it Sokanomics—is helping it weather this storm. Educating students is a highly expensive endeavor, with the bulk of a college’s spending used to pay its faculty and staff. Much of the rest goes to maintaining its campus. Understanding how colleges and universities fund their operations begins with looking at two things—tuition and endowment—and how they work together. How much SUA relies on each to cover its expenses is unique among colleges and universities, a decision that was made at the school’s founding. “SUA was designed as a place to bring together a global community where students can learn from professors and one another,” said Archibald Asawa, vice president of finance and administration. “One of the goals—the dream—was to offer need-based financial aid to all students, domestic or international, and Soka remains among the very few colleges that offer such aid to international students. We also wanted to accept students on a need-blind basis, so admission is based on their academic achievements, alignment with our mission, and their potential to contribute to the community, not their ability to pay.” In addition to SUA’s policy of need-blind admissions and comparatively low tuition, it waives tuition entirely for both domestic and international students from families with incomes of less than $60,000. “Whether you are a student from Santa Ana or Nepal, no matter where you are from, we waive tuition for those families,” said Asawa. The result of these policies is that most SUA students pay far less tuition than most of their peers at other colleges. A school’s discount rate is the total amount of aid awarded to undergraduates as a percentage of the total tuition and fees a school would collect if every student paid the full price. SUA’s discount rate—78%—is among the highest in the country, according to Asawa. The average at private colleges was 51% in 2019, and for all colleges 46%, according to the National Association of College and University Business Officers. So how is SUA’s generous financial aid policy possible? Two reasons: the size of its endowment and the generosity of its donors. In 2001, SUA was founded with an endowment of about $200 million. This year, it stands at about $1.3 billion. To get a better sense of what that means and how it compares to other schools, the size of the endowment should be considered alongside the size of the student body. With 406 undergraduates, SUA’s endowment per student is the second highest in the country, ranking behind only Princeton University. “The level and quality of what SUA offers students are available because of incredibly generous donations made by thousands of individuals and families from around the world who believe in the mission of the university and in the students who are here to immerse themselves in the Soka experience,” said Eric Reker ‘09, SUA’s investment analyst. “We have been able to consistently provide this support because of them, as well as the wisdom and vision of our board in managing our endowment.” With SUA’s endowment so critical to its ability to continue need-blind admissions in the future, it must be carefully managed. Endowments grow through investment gains, as well as through donations. As the endowment is drawn down to be used for expenses, it reduces the amount that can be invested. Market returns are also variable, and a few years of a down or flat market will have a dramatic impact on the endowment’s size. To maintain the health and perpetuity of the endowment principal, SUA’s Board of Trustees set an annual spending policy of 3.5% to 4%, said Asawa. Drawing down the endowment at that rate covers about 80% of SUA’s annual operating expenses. Tuition covers roughly 10% to 12 %, and the remaining gap of 8% to 10% is filled primarily from SUA’s donors. Last spring, as COVID-19 began its spread around the globe, SUA quickly made plans to address the negative impact the pandemic would have on students and their families, on university donors, and as a result, on the university’s finances. Facing a sizable deficit for this current fiscal year, a variety of “austerity measures” were enacted, Asawa said, including freezing salaries, cutting back on non-essential hiring, eliminating all non-essential travel and professional development, and greatly reducing operating expenses and utilities wherever possible. As a result, the university has not had to lay off or furlough any employees, and has continued to maintain employer contributions toward their retirement. “Because of our fiscal discipline and endowment, we are quite fortunate relative to many other colleges and universities that have had to implement extensive staff and faculty furloughs and layoffs, as well as suspend contributions toward their retirement plans,” said Asawa.”We really wanted to financially support our SUA community during the time of this pandemic.” To support students and their families, the Board of Trustees last spring rescinded a tuition increase that had been approved for the academic year, keeping tuition, room, and board costs at last year’s level. It also created a special coronavirus relief grant equal to 25% of tuition for all students for the 2020-21 academic year. In addition, those students awarded merit scholarships to cover their room and board expenses received checks this semester to cover these costs during this remote instruction period. “All in all, we provided over $7 million in institutional aid, including $1.6 million in the form of our coronavirus relief grant to students,” said Asawa. Enrollment of first-year students this fall was down slightly from projections, although less than the 16% average decline at colleges nationwide, and some new costs have been incurred to support online learning. The Board of Trustees did approve a special endowment distribution this year to make up for any potential budget shortfall, said Asawa. No one can say when the pandemic will end, or how long the economy will take to rebound, but SUA’s finances remain stable. “We can only do this because of the generosity of the people who believe in our mission,” said Asawa. “What our university founder did was create a special place to gather and develop global citizens who will become the future leaders in society and for peace. I always tell people to be mindful about everything we spend because these funds carry the hopes and dreams of our sincere donors.”", "categories": ["Soka at 20", "Supporting Soka", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "November 09, 2020", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Because of the pandemic the physical bookstore is currently closed. “When we realized the pandemic was not going to be over quickly,” bookstore Manager Lorraine Oda said, “we wanted to create an option for students and friends to have access to SUA merchandise and knew we needed an online store.” The site offers everything from sweatshirts and keychains to license plate frames, and new merchandise is added regularly. Unlike some merchants that up-charge for online goods, prices on the website are the same. Customers can also have purchases shipped to a different address. If you add a note to your order stating that it’s a gift, the packing slip with pricing will be omitted. There’s also a gift-wrapping option with a note for the recipient. The website also features a “Campus Marketplace” that helps students get course materials during remote learning. Students can buy and sell used textbooks, and search for textbooks they need based on their courses. To celebrate its relaunch, the online bookstore is offering two promotions—10% off the highest priced item and free shipping (within the contiguous US) for orders over $75. —Nagisa Smalheiser ’21", "categories": ["Campus News"], "date_publish": "November 20, 2020", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Over the years, many issues have moved Yarrow to commit his time and talent: equal rights, peace, the environment, gender equality, homelessness, hospice care, and education. All have utilized his skills as a performer and organizer. Along with his singing partners, Paul Stookey and Mary Travers, Yarrow participated in the Civil Rights Movement, which brought them to Washington, DC, in 1963 to sing for the historic march led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., as well as the equally historic Selma-Montgomery march in 1965.

Chowdhury, joined by Mrs. Chowdhury, to discuss “Why the Culture of Peace is So Essential to Humanity?”  Sponsored by the Office of Academic Affairs, this event, along with the Learning Cluster he has taught for 9 years, is a way for Ambassador Chowdhury to pay special tribute to Soka University and its founder, Daisaku Ikeda, engaging students and spreading the message of transformational opportunities of the Culture of Peace amongst the SUA students. Dr. Michael Weiner, Associate Dean of Faculty and Professor of East Asian History and International Studies, introduced Ambassador Chowdhury.  Thanking the community for a warm welcome, Ambassador gave a brief history of the development of The Culture of Peace concept, explaining its international start at the level of UNESCO and further development through his pioneering, dedicated efforts with the United Nations General Assembly in 1999.  He emphasized that one can reach their goals through non-violent, peaceful means, which is very much in line with the objective of preparing for global citizenship as incorporated in the SUA mission statement. Chowdhury articulated why the Culture of Peace is essential to humanity through what he terms as “the five I’s”.  First, the culture of peace supports Individual transformation when you make peace and non-violence a part of your daily existence.   It also focuses on Interconnectedness .  We are all interconnected and interdependent in so many ways to each other as human beings, through areas of sustainable development, human rights, education, equality, empowerment, understanding, tolerance, and solidarity.  Third, the culture of peace is Intergenerational , spanning across all ages, including even the very young ones.  Chowdhury brought to attention to the growing focus of the international community on the need for early childhood development to ensure the culture of peace becomes sustainable. Fourth, the culture of peace is International as it transcends boundaries, reaches out to everyone without exclusion and can be promoted by all, individually and collectively. Lastly, the culture of peace is Inspirational as it aims at self-transformation of every human being to make our planet a better place to live for all. The culture of peace is inspirational because it advances global citizenship and promotes human security. Chowdhury also outlined the four biggest obstacles to the culture of peace, which are ignorance, indifference, insensitivity, and inaction.  Students and guests from the community enjoyed a question and answer session, sharing more thoughts on the culture of peace.  Ambassador Chowdhury concluded by encouraging the audience to continue to live with empathy and compassion and strive towards advancing the culture of peace - always. A warm reception followed the open house lecture with guests enjoying more conversation and light refreshments.", "categories": ["Performing Arts Center"], "date_publish": "March 01, 2018", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Tickets are $40 for adults; $32 for students, seniors, and active military families; and $29 each for groups of 10 or more. Purchase tickets online or by calling 949-480-4ART (4278). This will be the first time that Childs and D’Rivera have paired up to perform a public concert. Soka PAC’s General Manager David Palmer discusses how this came about: “While attending the Chamber Music America conference in January 2017, Billy Childs, the president of CMA, was interviewing Paquito D’Rivera as part of an award presentation. During the course of the conversation, both musicians stated how much they admired each other’s work, and that it was a pity that they had never actually performed together. At that point, Billy sat down at the piano and Paquito picked up his clarinet and they played together for the very first time. My immediate thought was–why not ask them if they want to do a concert together?” Pianist Childs has emerged as one of the foremost American composers of his era, successfully marrying the musical products of his heritage with the Western neoclassical traditions of the twentieth century in a powerful symbiosis of style, range, and dynamism. Childs has garnered 16 Grammy nominations and five awards, most recently for the 2018 Best Jazz Instrumental Album ( Rebirth ). Previously he won two for Best Instrumental Composition (“Into the Light” from Lyric and “The Path Among the Trees” from Autumn: In Moving Pictures ) and two for Best Arrangement Accompanying a Vocalist (“New York Tendaberry” from Map to the Treasure: Reimagining Laura Nyro and “What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?” from To Love Again ). In 2006, Childs was awarded a Chamber Music America Composer’s Grant, and in 2009 was the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship. He was also awarded the Doris Duke Performing Artist Award in 2013 and, most recently, the music award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 2015. D’Rivera defies categorization. The winner of 14 Grammy Awards, he is celebrated both for his artistry in Latin jazz and his achievements as a classical composer. Born in Havana, Cuba, he performed at age 10 with the National Theater Orchestra, studied at the Havana Conservatory of Music and, at 17, became a featured soloist with the Cuban National Symphony. Additionally, he was a founding member and co-director of the innovative musical ensemble Irakere. With its explosive mixture of jazz, rock, classical, and traditional Cuban music never before heard, Irakere toured extensively throughout America and Europe and won several Grammy nominations (1979, 1980) and a Grammy Award (1979). The National Endowment for the Arts affirms “he has become the consummate multinational ambassador, creating, and promoting a cross-culture of music that moves effortlessly among jazz, Latin, and Mozart.”", "categories": ["Performing Arts Center"], "date_publish": "February 07, 2018", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

It is sponsored by East-West Center, Harvard University’s Ash Institute for Democratic Governance and Innovation, United Nations University and the Soka University of America. The Study Group will examine emerging issues in theory and practice of civil society engagement to promote and strengthen inclusive governance at national and global levels. Context Advancement in the achievement of development objectives in developing countries including those in Asia and the Pacific has been constrained by many factors: an inability to sustain government initiatives due to weak linkages between larger governance processes and program level intervention; weaknesses in basic transaction cost infrastructure including the judiciary, police, and revenue and land administration; high levels of corruption which impedes government reinvention; and the lack of a rigorous analysis of historical and legal context and socio-economic factors before initiating new government reinvention interventions.. Other challenges are the environmental degradation, inter and intra-state conflicts, inadequate access to basic social services, and low levels of women’s participation and the civil society engagement in economic and political activities. The 2005 the United Nations World Summit Outcome Document emphasizes the centrality of governance capacity development in multiple contexts, including the eradication of extreme poverty, the promotion of economic growth and economic development. Good governance and effective public administration are necessary conditions to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in the region. With this in view, countries are emphasizing the need to improve governance systems and processes to promote sustainable development. The multi-lateral agencies and bilateral development partners have been supporting the efforts of the countries in the region. Civil society organizations play a vital role in promoting inclusive governance i.e. governance characterized by the principles of accountability, transparency, participation, access, equity, subsidiarity and the rule of law. They play their roles both at the national and global levels, recognizing that improving the quality of democratic governance process requires actions both at the national and global levels. Rapid pace of globalization and the emergence of regional institutions with mandates to promote and protect such public goods as human rights, democracy, and access to basic services have influence on national democratic governance process and vice-versa. At the national level, civil society organizations are performing the watchdog functions to improve the quality of electoral and parliamentary process including electoral monitoring, voter education, training of candidates especially women and responsiveness of parliamentarians to the interests of minorities, poor and marginalized groups. Furthermore, they work for public interest law reform, enhance access of the poor to justice through paralegal services, and undertake advocacy and accountability of public officials including informing media about violations by the public officials. Their most widely recognized role in democratic governance process, however, is their promotion and protection of civil and political rights especially during civil wars and other crisis situations, and the establishment of the human rights institutions outside the government structures to investigate alleged violations of human rights, conduct public enquiries, and promote human rights education. At the global level, civil society organizations are performing advocacy functions for such global public goods as debt relief for the high debt and Least Developed Countries, climate change, implementation of the UN conventions and treaty bodies dealing with civil and political rights, transparency in global governance, and increased foreign assistance from the donor community. Examples of civil society organizations actively engaged in global governance are Transparency International, Human Rights Watch, Oxfam, Amnesty International and the World Association of Voluntary Organizations (CIVICUS). The Study Group will prepare concept papers and case studies of innovations and good practices concerning the civil society’s roles in enhancing the quality of democratic governance practice in developing countries. Concept papers will examine critical issues at the global levels. Case studies will focus on selected countries in Asia. Objectives The Study Group of Eminent Scholars on Civil Society Engagement in National and Global Governance will: Modalities and Outcomes The project will be undertaken by East-West Center in partnership with the Harvard University’s Ash Institute for Democratic Governance and Innovation, United Nations University, and Soka University of America. A workshop of authors of book chapters will be organized at the East-West Center from 14 – 16 July 2008. The workshop will serve as the basis for a book on this important topic to be commercially published by the United Nations University Press, as a part of the Ash Institute’s Innovations in Governance Series. Follow-up activities will include country level study groups and the preparation of an inventory of civil society innovations in enhancing the quality of democratic governance practice with focus on Asia. The project will contribute to our understanding of civil society engagement in democratic governance process and the evolution and sustainability of innovations in promoting inclusive governance at the national and global levels. It will also promote capacity building of training and research institutions, support the networks of innovators, and facilitate sharing of experiences and lessons learned among scholars. Draft table of contents and the list of potential members of the Study Group are enclosed.

Background One of the very first acknowledgements of the nexus between development and security came from the representatives of 45 countries who gathered in Bretton Woods in 1944. Still amidst the most devastating war in the history of humanity they intended to design foundations for a new world based on principles of “freedom from fear” and “freedom from want.” More than sixty years after this eventful meeting, which laid the moral, legal and institutional foundations of the contemporary international system, the international community is still facing similar challenges. Collective violence in its different forms is wide spread in the world and there is substantial empirical evidence of links between various forms of political violence (including wars) and inadequate economic development. However, though many scholars and practitioners recognize that development and conflict are intertwined, there is much less understanding (or at least consensus) about the mechanism behind these linkages. In many cases the causes of violence can be traced to social and economic conditions that produce frustration and humiliation among disadvantaged social groups. The question, which thus far has stayed outside of research focus, is how to identify strategy of development to reinforce the peaceful coexistence of different elements of the population and to encourage their cooperation. In the first decade of the 21st century, in the world, where boundaries are blurred, authorities are fragmented and often powerless against non-state actors, when new security threats emerge and metastasize unpredictably, the “development-security” nexus has acquired new meaning and urges a coordinated response. For this reason in December 2005 the United Nations created the United Nations Peacebuilding Infrastructure, which is comprised of the Peacebuilding Commission, the Peacebuilding Fund and the Peacebuilding Support Office. In its turn, the World Bank set up the Conflict Prevention and Reconstruction Team in its Social Development Department in 2005; similar units were created in regional development banks and some aid agencies. A global conflict syndrome – the sum of factors that work in parallel to undermine the stability of international system and erode the foundations of human security – requires rigorous analysis of multiple linkages between development patterns and conflicts as well as innovative ideas of how to effectively incorporate conflict prevention into the development interventions. Policy interventions based on erroneous theoretical assumptions or inconclusive empirical basis are known to have brought unanticipated negative results. Greater understanding of the links between economic development patterns and predispositions to avoid or engage in such conflicts would be very valuable to policymakers, policy advocates, and officials of agencies providing bilateral and multilateral assistance. The focus of our project will be both at the national and international levels. Although development strategies play out largely within nation states, or even at sub-national levels, international actors, including inter-governmental financial institutions, national governments of other countries, international non-governmental organizations, and multinational corporations play significant roles in the development initiatives that they recommend, finance, or implement. In our project we attempt to fill this gap. It is our assumption that sectoral and regional development strategies, strategies that target distribution of general assets as well as state-society interactions and other strategies used in the pursuit of development have been essential in shaping economic development patterns and eventually, in defining particular types of state-society interactions conducive to peace or violence. Workshop Purpose The Workshop will bring together scholars and development practitioners with an in-depth knowledge of particular regions of the developing world as well as sectors which are believed particularly closely associated with peace and conflict dynamics: tourism, water use and development assistance. The participants have been commissioned to write working papers on development strategies in the areas of their expertise. The focus on cross-country comparison will offer important opportunities to exchange information and current research findings, to build upon existing knowledge, to debate a number of commonly held perceptions and theories and to identify parallels, if any, between development strategies and their security-relevant results. Workshop Objectives: Workshop Methodology From a methodological point of view the focus of the project is on comparative analysis of single case studies (countries, regions within countries, and other political units at different historical stages). Particular case studies were selected on the basis of their similarities in major determinants of development (geography, history, culture, ethnic diversity and resource endowments, etc.) but different choices of development strategies. From our perspective, such multiple-case-study approach is more suitable for an in-depth understanding of conflict-development linkages compared with large-N studies, as it allows to take into account the international, national and local levels of development conflict interaction and examine roles and mutual influences of the different echelons of society. The case studies will lead to inductive learning insofar as different development patterns can be connected through thick description to the avoidance of provocation, the strengthening of deterrence, or social integration models with reinforcing evidence from the more violent comparison countries insofar as they experienced different development patterns. The methodology of the Workshop will be interactive and participatory with a focus on comparative analysis of case studies. Special emphasis will be placed on the discussion of common methodological and epistemological challenges and an eventual objective of producing comprehensive and consistent analysis of the subject. Expected Outcome of the Workshop It is the expectation of the workshop conveners that the meeting will lead to insights that will enable eventual contributions in a proper comparative light for a planned volume that will be truly comparative in nature rather than a simple juxtaposition of different country and sector studies.

The workshop will be held from June 30 - July 1, 2010 at East-West Center in Honolulu, Hawaii. The workshop focuses an emerging concern for democratic governance – how the concept of sustainability can inform policymaking that addresses pressing challenges without compromising the long-term needs of future generations. Objectives This workshop seeks to reveal factors that influence formation of sustainable or unsustainable policies in the public and private sectors. Context and Issues Political decision-making within a democratic structure tends to be inherently shortsighted, as the pursuit of electoral office and the immediate demands of constituents are of central concern to elected officials and bureaucrats (“short-termism”). However, policies designed to meet these short-term needs can often fail to address, or even actively work against, the needs of future generations. Similarly, managers in business are often encouraged – implicitly or explicitly – to concentrate on short-term profit over approaches which would bring more sustainable long-term success. In developing countries with weak democratic institutions and inegalitarian social and economic structures, the formulation and implementation of sustainable policies is an enormous challenge. Politicians are faced with any number of short-term problems, requiring immediate attention and responses. But these short-term problems must be reconciled with the demands of less immediate, but no less important, longer-term public needs and goals. Expected Outcomes The workshop is expected to lead to the following: Organization The workshop will be organized in the form of a facilitated dialogue among about 25 senior level experts. Each participant has identified a topic of interest related to sustainability and policy-making. After the plenary sessions in the morning of the first day, the participants will be divided into three groups. Each group will examine sustainability of policymaking related to a set of issues including climate change, education and health, human development, natural resource management, poverty alleviation, population growth, food security, peace-building, regional cooperation, and the financial crisis.

Conference Description Today it is commonplace to witness a cultural phenomenon in the Asian-Pacific that has generated a rapid deconstruction of cultural boundaries and the cultural border-crossings under the constantly changing social/political environments. It has become important to have an understanding of how we represent ourselves and the others under such worldwide border-crossing cultural changes. It may be imperative, therefore, for us to have a good grasp of how we communicate with the other and how culture disseminates itself under the cultures in motion. In a sense a precondition to do so for us is the recognition of our co-existence under globalization with our neighboring countries. The studies in humanities that pursue communicativeness and co-existence through a study of humans, language, gender, economics, mass-communications, etc. have their much relevance to the most sensitive problems of our time. Cultural Studies in service of communicativeness and co-existence can play a role in interdisciplinary studies among the fields in humanities, even extends the objects of and deepens the study in humanities so that we can have diverse perspectives and lay out a foundation for future-oriented studies in humanities. Scholars need to strengthen the practicality and place-basedness of the knowledge humanities produce, in order to relate the knowledge to our life. This conference, jointly held by the Asian Cultural Studies Research Institute at Kyungwon University and the Pacific Basin Research Center at Soka University of America, will provide scholars from the two universities with a venue to discuss its theme of cultural communication and cultural dissemination in the Asian-Pacific and also an opportunity to broaden the horizon of cultural studies.

Feasel Named President of Soka University of America", "text": "Edward M. Feasel has been appointed the second president of Soka University of America, the SUA Board of Trustees announced. Feasel, who most recently served as executive vice president and chief operating officer, replaces founding President Daniel Y. Habuki effective today. Feasel has had a long and distinguished career at Soka, beginning in 1998 as the first dean of students at SUA’s Aliso Viejo campus. He has also served as dean of faculty, as vice president for academic affairs and chief academic officer. Feasel has also been active as a professor of economics, mentoring many students over the years. Habuki, who announced his retirement in June , was named president emeritus of the university. “Soka University of America could not have come this far without the extraordinary efforts of Dr. Daniel Habuki,” SUA Board of Trustees Chair Stephen Dunham wrote in a statement. “In recognition of his sincere and heartfelt leadership over the past 27 years, the Board of Trustees has named Dr. Habuki as President Emeritus of SUA in deep appreciation for his years of service and dedication to the university.” Feasel received his PhD in economics from the University of California, Berkeley, and his BA in economics magna cum laude from Yale University. Prior to coming to Soka, he worked at the Public Policy Institute of California, UC Berkeley, George Washington University, Central European University in Prague, Czech Republic, and the University of Economics, Bratislava, Slovak Republic. Feasel has published numerous scholarly articles and books, most recently Trade Policy and Economic Growth in Eras of Globalization , and Japan’s Aid: Lessons for Economic Growth, Development and Political Economy. “Given his extensive experience and vision for SUA’s future,” Dunham wrote, “Dr. Feasel personifies the attributes that the Board was seeking in appointing our next president.” Feasel said he is inspired by the founding principles of the university founder Daisaku Ikeda, and shared his vision in a statement that accompanied the announcement of his appointment. Feasel also introduced his new leadership team. “As we enter into the 20th anniversary of SUA in Aliso Viejo,” Dunham wrote, “we look forward to Dr. Feasel’s dynamic leadership and have full confidence in him to elevate SUA to the next level and fulfill our grand mission for peace, human rights, and the sanctity of life through supporting and educating our students to become global citizens committed to these ideals.”", "categories": ["Campus News"], "date_publish": "July 17, 2020", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},
{"newspaper": "soka-news", "url": "https://www.soka.edu/news-events/news/challenging-times-peace-gala-exceeds-fundraising-expectations", "title": "In Challenging Times, Peace Gala Exceeds Fundraising Expectations", "text": "Hundreds of members of the Soka community came together online for this year’s Peace Gala, surpassing the event’s fundraising goal while celebrating the university’s mission. The 16th annual event, “Celebrating a Vision of Peace,” was held virtually on October 10. More than $670,000 was raised for the Soka scholarship endowment, eclipsing last year’s total, despite the challenges of the pandemic and going virtual. In an effort to make the gala available to those who have wanted to attend but been unable to, admission was not charged. More than 300 people from around the world viewed the live-stream. The Peace Gala is Soka’s largest fundraising event. In his opening remarks, President Ed Feasel noted that about 88% of Soka students receive need-based financial aid. In the last 15 years, students have received $191 million in financial assistance. Master of ceremonies DawnMarie Kotsonis carried the evening virtually just as dynamically as she has in person, expressing gratitude to donors for their investment not only in Soka’s students but, by extension, the future of the world. The agenda included a performance by Grammy-winning songwriter Paul Williams, video interviews with students about Soka’s mission of global citizenship, and virtual testimonials from two SUA alumni who are doctors working on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic, Kimiko Tsuchiya ’08 and Isamu Yoshioka ’05. Both doctors attended the university before it offered pre-med courses such as those now included in the Life Sciences concentration, yet they said the humanistic education they received at Soka prepared them to become compassionate doctors, a quality that is critical to their work today. An interactive bidding experience was a unique feature of the evening. As attendees watched the gala on one screen, they could bid on silent auction items and make donations on other screens. Soka staff was also available to assist donors by phone. Longtime donor and Gala committee member Judy Chow donated more than $50,000 this year. “SUA is raising capable youth for the betterment of society and world,” Chow said. “I always feel it’s a bright beacon of light in this world of problems and conflicts.” The online silent auction started one week before the Peace Gala, and Chow began participating ahead of time and continued throughout the event. “I got my friends to come in and bid and they were trying to outbid me so it was kind of fun,” she said. “I tried to bid on all the items, and then your friends text you that they outbid you and you have to go back in.” New York comedian and stock market wizard Michael Young Cho, and longtime SUA donor Marylou Berk each donated matching challenges of $10,000. Berk’s donation was made in honor of her late husband, musician Allen Berk, one of SUA’s most dedicated and beloved supporters. His obituary included a request for mourners to donate to Soka. “Allen was ever so dedicated to the cause of Soka,” Berk said. “He passed away six weeks before his 91st birthday, which was always on the weekend of the Gala, and while he couldn’t be there physically, we certainly knew he was there.” “Allen and I were together 45 years and there wasn’t one moment he was not absolutely clear about the necessity to support and move this world forward, and move people forward,” said Berk. “When Soka opened up 20 years ago, he knew it was the perfect platform for delivering that mission. He was totally absolute in his mission of supporting Soka University for the reason of moving the world forward.” Chow expressed the same appreciation for Soka’s mission.“There are so many universities,” she said. “SUA has a unique mission and I hope it stays eternally diligent in that mission. We tend to have grand goals as humans, but I think it’s important to have the correct perspective.” “The core reason for Soka University to exist is value-creation around the world, the interconnectedness of all people, and the sharing and giving while each and every individual obtains a decent life and success,” Berk said. “The proof of what we see in the students who graduate and give back to society through their own successes is why it is paramount that we continue to support SUA. We like to think of ourselves as an inverted pyramid. We are at the bottom and the students are at the top.” A video recording of the gala can be viewed online.", "categories": ["Soka at 20", "Supporting Soka", "Peace Gala"], "date_publish": "November 09, 2020", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

{"newspaper": "soka-news", "url": "https://www.soka.edu/news-events/news/diet-and-disease-learning-eat-healthier-budget", "title": "Diet and Disease: Learning to Eat Healthier on a Budget", "text": "More than four million Californians were receiving benefits from CalFresh , the state’s food assistance program, at the start of 2020. When the pandemic hit, more people than ever found themselves struggling to pay for food and signing up for benefits. At the same time, the pandemic reminded people of the link between healthy eating and a strong immune system. For individuals and policy experts alike, the question is how to spend less on food while eating a nutritious diet? Kennah Watts ’22 wanted to help find a solution. She created a document to educate people about nutrition and offer healthy recipes using affordable ingredients. “I wanted healthy eating to be seen as more accessible,” Watts said, “and not just a luxury for people who can afford fancy cookbooks or fitness guides.” Watts’ guide includes breakfast, lunch, snack, and dinner ideas based on the monthly allowance for CalFresh recipients. It also provides nutritional information for each meal, and explanations about why certain foods are healthier choices than others. Watts posted the guide on LinkedIn , so anyone with Internet access could view it. She wants to spread the information more widely and plans to send the guide to CalFresh as well as local health organizations. Watts created the guide as a final project for Diet and Disease, a Soka Learning Cluster course. Learning Cluster, Soka’s intensive three-and-half-week winter block session, offers classes co-designed by students and faculty during the Fall semester. They allow a deeper examination of subjects of all kinds, and aim to contribute to positive change in the community. Lisa Crummett, associate professor of biology, developed the January course to examine how diet relates to human health and chronic disease. She’s been fascinated by the topic for years. Prof. Crummett teaches Human Body in a Modern World, which looks at the global industrial diet and how food is directly related to metabolic disease. She wrote a chapter about the connection between sugar and disease in a recently published book, The Shapes of Epidemics and Global Disease , edited by Cal State Fullerton’s Andrea Patterson and SUA’s Ian Read. So it was natural for her to offer the topic as a Learning Cluster course. On the online bulletin board that replaced lunch-table discussions during this pandemic-altered year, she posted about her interest in studying diet and metabolic disease. A number of students commented that they would like to look into the connection between socioeconomic status and disease, how access to food and inability to buy healthy food influences why people eat the way they do, and why low-income groups are much more likely to acquire insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The three-hour-long classes were conducted online, so professors had to get creative in order to fight Zoom fatigue. Some professors had students lead discussion forums instead of holding lectures, and others had students create avatars of themselves on gather.town to interact in a digital classroom. The Diet and Disease class welcomed Guillermo Alvarez, a program coordinator from Latino Health Access , a grassroots organization in Santa Ana that combats public health problems in local communities of uninsured and underserved families. Whether it’s through helping someone control their diabetes or getting people vaccinated for Covid-19, the organization envisions a “healthy, equitable, inclusive and prosperous community that is engaged and civically active.” Latino Health Access is a network of promotores —employees and volunteers who build trust and create lasting relationships within their neighborhoods. They educate their communities about breast cancer, diabetes, domestic violence, parenting, obesity, and many other public health issues. Alvarez invited students interested in non-profit work to volunteer with LHA. Later in the course, students also had the opportunity to learn knife skills from chef Jessica Van Roo, assistant director of Culinary Recreation and Experiential Programs at UC Irvine. She joined students for a Zoom lesson on how to prepare and cook meals at home, demonstrating various cooking techniques, how to prepare meals in advance to save on prep time on weekdays, how to correctly hold a knife, and how to safely and easily chop different types of vegetables. Students participated with their own knives, cutting boards, and vegetables. The session was similar to what Van Roo does in her nutrition classes at UCI and her work at the UCI recreation center. The training is often geared towards medical students. In the United States, medical students learn to treat disease but often miss out on learning how to prevent disease in the first place—which is where Van Roo hopes to make a difference. At the end of the class session, she invited Soka students to reach out to her for possible internship opportunities. After learning these new cooking techniques, Prof. Crummett asked students to get into their own kitchens and film themselves cooking a meal. With students attending the class from all over the world, dishes ranged from gimbap to banana pancakes to cauliflower tacos and pico de gallo. Will Schult ’22 shared how to make curried lentils in his cooking video, and for his final project, decided to make an informational website about the health effects of added sugar, with further emphasis on its prevalence in drinks. It also discussed options for how to remove added sugar from your diet. “My favorite part of the class was how much it forced me to reassess my diet,” Schult said. “Over the course of it, I was able to make immediate and significant changes in how I ate and how my diet made me feel.” To find out more about the other learning clusters offered this year, read the article From Disneyland to Data Analysis: 2021’s Learning Clusters . —Nagisa Smalheiser ’21", "categories": ["Learning Clusters", "Undergraduate Academics", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "March 31, 2021", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

BACKGROUND: In his 1996 address at Teachers College, Columbia University, Soka University of America Founder Daisaku Ikeda said: “Global society today faces myriad interlocking crises. These include the issues of war, environmental degradation, the North-South development gap, and divisions among people based on differences of ethnicity, religion, or language. The list is long and familiar, and the road to solutions may seem all too distant and daunting. It is my view, however, that the root of all these problems is our collective failure to make the human being – human happiness – the consistent focus and goal in all fields of endeavor. The human being is the point to which we must return and from which we must depart anew. What is required is a human transformation – a human revolution.” In this address, Mr. Ikeda further shared the essential elements of global citizenship:", "categories": ["Soka at 20", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "November 18, 2020", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

{"newspaper": "soka-news", "url": "https://www.soka.edu/news-events/news/20th-anniversary-committee-builds-toward-significant-milestone", "title": "20th Anniversary Committee Builds Toward a Significant Milestone", "text": "As Soka University of America prepares to celebrate two decades of educating global citizens on May 3, 2021, it has announced a 20th Anniversary Steering Committee to lead initiatives to mark the milestone and expand the university’s singular mission. The Steering Committee comprises the Soka Leadership Council, two representatives of the Soka Student Union, one representative of the Faculty Executive Committee, Director of Community Relations Wendy Harder, Director of the Library Hiroko Tomono, and Professor Phat Vu. Its work will be carried out by seven project-based subcommittees. “The overall theme is to recommit to the principles upon which SUA was founded and particularly to our mission of education for global citizenship,” President Ed Feasel said. “I was one of the founding members of the Aliso Viejo campus, and at the beginning we focused a lot on that mission in the curriculum. But over this last year, given what is happening in society and also at SUA, I have really come to feel that education for global citizenship is also very much about an ethic or value that people hold. There are spiritual and ethical dimensions to our mission that I don’t think we have emphasized, but which are needed right now.” Following the unprecedented global events and challenges of 2020, including incidents on Soka’s campus, it became clear to university leaders that the founding principles need to be more thoroughly and consistently modeled. “The issues that we are confronting regarding race,” Feasel said, “are part of this effort to foster global citizens.” To support that goal, in addition to the 20th Anniversary Committee’s work, the university will also collaborate closely with the new Center for Race, Ethnicity, and Human Rights and its new Unity and Diversity Council, whose efforts will be more clearly defined next semester. The effort to recommit to the founding principles of SUA requires fostering a culture of global citizenship that can simultaneously be studied, examined, discussed, and experienced. (A thorough review of those principles can be found on a new 20th anniversary web page , which also showcases a timeline of milestones over past decades.) “The second stage of SUA is global citizenship in action, moving from a theoretical to an actual experience of being a global citizen,” Feasel said. To that end, the new committee’s work will span four broad areas: dialogic, through a number of new centers and events that will curate conversations across campus communities; pedagogical, with a refreshed implementation of the study of global citizenship across curricula; environmental, with campus updates to honor SUA founder Daisaku Ikeda’s unique definition of global citizenship; and a new Soka Global Citizen Award annually presented to an individual who embodies global citizenship. While the qualities of global citizenship—wisdom, compassion, and courage—are innate, they are not dominant in our society, Feasel said. “It takes concerted effort to live by those qualities. There should be a global citizenship class at every level of education in every school throughout the world, because I think that’s what’s needed to enhance those qualities in individuals in society so that we then make better decisions, take better action, and make better policies.” If SUA is able to successfully convey and practice its founding principles, Feasel said, the university can become a model for educational institutions around the world. To implement the 20th Anniversary Committee’s various initiatives, the following seven subcommittees have been formed:", "categories": ["Soka at 20", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "December 11, 2020", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

The second World Summit of Educators , sponsored by Soka University of America, offered myriad solutions, and the online event itself was an energy-maker. Registration data indicated that of the 344 participants from 20 countries, 142 were teachers. “It was so refreshing to hear how young people, who may not seem to have a lot of authority and access to levers of power, can change the world by virtue of their energy, optimism, and hope,” said summit co-chair Bryan Penprase, SUA vice president for sponsored research and external academic relations. Global educators and citizens face a remarkable opportunity to “build forward better” after the pandemic and movements for social justice, Wanjira Mathai said in the summit’s keynote address . “Inclusion, resilience, and shared prosperity must be at the heart of how we will, and we must, build forward better,” said Mathai, vice president and regional director for Africa at the World Resources Institute. “Education has to be a major part of how we invest for a more sensible future,” she said. “It’s crucial that we do not go back to the old ways of doing things. Everything will have to change, including our education systems and how we prepare our young people in particular for the future.” Mathai touched on education during climate change, building youth leadership, sustainable energy and landscape restoration — familiar themes in Soka Education. “Her work, along with that of several speakers, showed in many ways that they are speaking the same language that we at Soka University of America are offering in our mission statement,” Penprase said. “Working in and searching for empowerment through environmental justice in Africa is entirely aligned with our dedication to the interconnectedness of humanity and nature and the power of education to unlock human potential.” With the theme of “Educating for Global Citizenship: Building an Equitable, Peaceful and Sustainable World,” the summit emphasized wisdom, courage, and compassion as well as the four pillars of education: peace, development, environment, and human rights. The June 13 summit drew participants from Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, French Guiana, Germany, Greece, Guyana, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Malaysia, Netherlands, Spain, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and Venezuela. Registration data showed that 43 percent of attendees came from outside the United States, and this diversity helped summit organizers meet their goal of building visibility and relationships with educators across the world. Organized by SUA graduate students, the summit also coincided with the 20th anniversary of the university’s Aliso Viejo campus and the 25th anniversary of a seminal moment: university founder Daisaku Ikeda’s address at Columbia University Teachers College in 1996. “A speech that received little attention for 20 years has now become a driving force for change,” said 2021 summit emcee Prince Paa-Kwesi Heto, a 2016 SUA master’s graduate in educational leadership and societal change who co-chaired the first summit in 2016. SUA President Ed Feasel opened the summit with news of two initiatives — the Global Solutions Institute and the Pacific Alliance of Liberal Arts Colleges — to support education for global citizenship and research in pursuit of United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The new institute will also develop working groups to develop a course curriculum on education for global citizenship for every level of education from primary school through university. Summit participants also heard messages of solidarity including from former UN Under-Secretary-General Anwarul K. Chowdhury. Urgency came through remarks from Soka University of Japan President Yoshihisa Baba. “Society, the world, and humanity is in danger of being disunited,” President Baba said, noting the pandemic and other world-wide issues. “We are faced with global issues such as infectious diseases, global warming, and climate change that cannot be solved by mere individuals.” Mathai is familiar to the SUA community. Maathai Hall is named for her mother, 2004 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Wangari Maathai (1940-2011). Ikeda recalled meeting Maathai and listening to “her hopes to convey to the younger generation that a genuinely fulfilling life is realized when one devotes one’s life for the sake of others,” said his message read by President Feasel. “Thank you for honoring my mother on your campus, because I know just how much she connected with the principles we’re talking about today, that education is at the heart of how we transform the lives of everyone,” Mathai said. The current “reset” of society, she said, depends on care for the environment, as her mother demonstrated with the Green Belt Movement. Today, 900,000 Kenyan women have planted more than 51 million trees to restore Kenya’s soil. Mathai noted that the world’s food supply depends on small farmers, most of whom are women. “My mother understood profoundly well that education is about bridging the knowledge and practice gap,” she said. When illiterate farmers used their knowledge to help solve deforestation, they became empowered to stop public corruption. Mathai described this as “the noble work that education in all its forms does to empower to enable one to find their agency and to begin to do things for themselves.” Peace and equality, Mathai said, are built from the ground up, with unwavering faith that “the wheat planted today will feed generations to come.” Global citizenship “is not about boundaries, it is not about languages,” she said. “It is actually across generations… Global citizenship is an expression of how we show up.” She urged the summit attendees to commit to four actions (produce, protect, reduce, and restore) that make the natural world “the heart of how we move forward,” and to teach children to do the same “because we only protect what we love.” While the threat of climate change is enormous—an estimated 100 million people are at risk of poverty from climate change, joining 3 billion people with inadequate access to clean water—everyone can do something. “We have to start with what we can do, and in most cases you can protect the environment around you,” Mathai said. “The sort of challenges we are facing in the world today require that we leverage other parts of ourselves and bring other parts of ourselves to bear,” she said in closing. Spanning 10 hours, the summit offered meaningful insights about educating global citizens. Here is a sampling. Building on the achievements of the 2016 World Summit of Educators, the second summit advanced Mr. Ikeda’s vision, said summit co-chair Tomoko Takahashi, SUA vice president for institutional research and assessment, and dean of the Graduate School. And organizers intend to continue to work toward that vision – that a network of educators committed to teaching global perspectives is vital to world peace and advancing human welfare, dignity, and equality – in the years to come. “The founder was absolutely right about the need to create ‘an era of education and peace in which the smiling faces of every child and youth will brighten our world’ is becoming apparent each day,” Takahashi said. “Our discussions and the report from the Youth Summit convinced me that we need to double our effort if we are to actualize his vision. “However, I felt hopeful seeing all the people doing great work in the education arena. There are many people who also want to contribute. We at SUA are well-positioned to provide the nurturing space, intellectual home, and guidance to those seeking to contribute.” –Michelle Hiskey", "categories": ["Soka at 20", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "July 06, 2021", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Such a topic may seem odd for the nation of Amazonian jungles and rivers, but Brazil has enormous regions that have long suffered from drought and water mismanagement. In January 2019, students were introduced to Brazilian history, society, and political economy through a close examination of the Grande Seca (Great Drought) that killed between 200,000-400,000 people in Northeastern Brazil in the late 19th century. Few know that this was the deadliest “natural” disaster in the Western Hemisphere since the arrival of Europeans. Students purposely moved from an understanding of the Grande Seca and subsequent droughts to an attempt to understand Brazil’s “redemption,” a counterfactual, but humanly possible and reinvented nation in which good water resources are neither precariously scarce nor so poorly distributed. Students continued their study of this topic over the spring and fall of 2019, including a small group which pursued historical research on the Grande Seca through independent study. The full group reconvened, and with the generous support of the Nieves Family Foundation, transported our study into the field for a 2020 Learning Cluster course. Over 10 days, students visited Ceará, a relatively impoverished state in the northeast the size of France, and São Paulo, a relatively wealthy megapolis 2,000 miles to the south. We talked with rural farmers, government secretaries, professors, and students, allowing for a unique comparison of the semi-arid northeast with the more temperate and urbanized south. In this process, students continued to compare the past with the present and the dilemmas of rural and urban water provision in geographically distinct regions of the huge country. The Learning Cluster ended with a Water Forum, hosted by the Soka Colegio of Brazil, and a conference on water rights and governance hosted by the Federal University of ABC. These valuable experiences recalled one more quote by Guimarães Rosa regarding a tendency that water and rigorous field-based study share: “The river doesn’t go in one direction; it just wants to be deeper.” Learning Cluster courses are one of the signature features of the SUA curriculum. Offered during winter block, a 3.5-week period in early January, the Learning Cluster is an immersive exploration of a problem of interest to faculty and students who co-design unique courses during the Fall semester. Learning Cluster faculty, with groups of 12 or fewer students, lead explorations across California and the world, where they gather information, observations, and experiences that will enable them to understand the full complexity of these problems and develop solutions together. This year, five Learning Clusters received a traveling grant from the Nieves Family Foundation to conduct research in Brazil, Rwanda, Sweden, South Korea, and China.", "categories": ["Academics", "Undergraduate Academics", "International Studies"], "date_publish": "February 11, 2020", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Carlisle has accepted a research fellowship in Nanjing, China, and Pierce will be an English teaching assistant in the Canary Islands of Spain. The fellowships, which will start in January, are part of the Fulbright US Student Program. The program, administered by the US State Department, is designed to build lasting connections between the people of the United States and other countries, which makes Soka students natural candidates. Two years ago Soka created a Fulbright Advising Program to help students navigate the rigorous application process. And now the program, led by anthropology professor Sarah England, has helped SUA students receive two Fulbright grants two years in a row. Carlisle, whose Soka concentration is Social and Behavioral Sciences, will be looking into how Black and Latinx music and dance, such as Hip Hop and Zumba dance, can be used to foster appreciation for and understanding of the histories and cultures of the US and China. Carlisle, from Los Angeles, was inspired by his semester studying abroad in China. “Even though Black and Latinx art forms are popular in China, there is still a lack of awareness toward the history and experiences of Black and Latinx people,” Carlisle said. “Similarly, although Chinese cultural expression, for example Tai Chi and Kung Fu, are extremely popular in the US, there is a great ignorance among Americans toward the history and the experiences of Chinese people. “The goal of my research is to explore how both Chinese and Afro-diasporic art forms can be used as bridges to enhance cultural appreciation , rather than perpetuate cultural appropriation .” Pierce, from Davis, California, said three international travel and education experiences at Soka sparked her interest in teaching abroad. As a freshman she was in Peru with biology professor Anthony Mazeroll’s Amazon research center. Before her junior year, she taught English to children in a service learning program in Chile. During her semester abroad in the Dominican Republic, she continued to hone her Spanish language skills and her awareness of Spain’s influence over Latin American culture. In addition to teaching English on the Canary Islands, Pierce, whose Soka concentration is Environmental Studies, will work on a community project involving conservation in marine ecosystems. “I hope to connect with the students in a way that inspires them to appreciate the environment and take care of nature,” Pierce said.", "categories": ["Fulbright", "Academics", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "May 04, 2020", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

With the theme of “Educating for Global Citizenship: Building an Equitable, Peaceful and Sustainable World,” the summit will emphasize the SUA attributes of wisdom, courage, and compassion as well as the four pillars of education (for peace, development, environment, and human rights). It will take place June 13-14, approximately six weeks after SUA celebrates its 20th anniversary on May 3. Registration is open at the World Summit of Educators webpage . “This is the dessert, or the icing, on the celebration,” Penprase said. SUA President Ed Feasel will open the event, which will also feature talks from President Yoshihisa Baba of Soka University Japan and educational leaders and practitioners from around the world. “I look forward to this year’s conference hosted by the undergraduate and graduate school programs as a wonderful expression of education for global citizenship,” Feasel said. The second World Summit of Educators, Feasel noted, also coincides with the 25th anniversary of a seminal moment in the philosophy that inspires SUA: university founder Daisaku Ikeda’s address at Columbia University Teachers College in 1996. “This address, titled ‘Thoughts on Education for Global Citizenship,’ continues to provide inspiration and vision for our community, especially as the university celebrates 20 years since we welcomed our first undergraduate class in 2001 and, based on this milestone, recommit to the university’s founding principles,” Feasel said. The 2016 event drew 80 invited attendees from 20 countries, while this year’s summit is expected to draw hundreds from a much wider area, said summit co-chair Tomoko Takahashi, vice president for institutional research and assessment as well as dean of the SUA Graduate School. “I had hoped this summit would become more global and the entire university would be involved and that’s happening,” she said. “For the second summit, we are expanding beyond global citizenship to respond to current affairs, which is very important. Equity, sustainability, and technology are very important for this summit, for us to be current and proactive in global education.” The rapidly developing summit honors the legacy of SUA’s graduate students who organized the 2016 summit, Takahashi said. She praised the diverse committee that organized the summit: Takahiro Asano GS ‘21 (representing graduate students), Esther Chang (representing the undergraduate faculty), Jay Heffron (representing the Graduate School faculty), Ian Read (representing the undergraduate faculty), Kentaro Shintaku ’23 (representing undergraduate students), Janna Skye (representing SUA staff), Megumi Tanaka ’11 (representing SUA alumni) and Phat Vu (representing undergraduate faculty). “I hope the World Summit of Educators will become a signature event that SUA holds every five years,” Takahashi said. The four education pillars will be highlighted in the keynote presentation by Wanjira Mathai, vice president and regional director for Africa at the World Resources Institute. Mathai will discuss the Green Belt Movement, an effort to reforest a span of Africa, and other work begun by her mother, 2004 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Wangari Maathai. Mathai will address education through climate change, building youth leadership, sustainable energy, and landscape restoration. “There is a connection between the environment, education, and social justice, not just for intrinsic value but to enable prosperity for all people,” Penprase said. “Her work is an interesting embodiment of the interconnectedness of humans and nature.” Another plenary speaker is Chula Vista Elementary School District Superintendent Francisco Escobedo, who will join a local teacher and parent to discuss “Unprecedented Student Outcomes: Toward the Oneness of Parents, Teachers, and School Leaders.” Escobedo is expected to inspire connections across the K-12 practitioners because of his holistic leadership, Penprase said. In a message sent to teachers, students, and families in his district, Escobedo wrote that 2020 “was a year for reflection, especially about what matters most: treating everyone with respect and compassion; acting with a commitment to equity, diversity, and inclusion in our work; taking time to appreciate one another and to build a stronger community; being open to perspectives that are not your own; and maintaining a laser-like focus on student outcomes.” “You won’t find a better statement of what we are doing here at SUA, and he’s doing that in a school district with serious challenges of overcapacity, and where families often have marginal incomes, and students often lack proper nutrition,” Penprase said.

That involvement will expand exponentially this June. Hundreds of students will gather a week before the World Summit of Educators to bring their voices to bear on the issues shaping the future of education at the first Youth Summit June 5-6. The theme of the student-organized summit is “Global Citizens: We Arise in a Time of Crisis.” It will be held on a virtual platform that can accommodate up to 1,000 participants under age 30, most of whom are in high school or college. SUA students are expected to make up about a quarter of the Youth Summit participants from all over the world. With a focus on the four intertwined actions of global citizenship—learn, respect, empower, and lead—the Youth Summit is expected to produce a report outlining future goals that will be presented at the World Summit of Educators June 13-14. The event began in the minds of student organizers Takahiro “Taka” Asano GS ’21, a master’s student in educational leadership and societal change, and Kentaro “Ken” Shintaku ’23, who is passionate about education. They brainstormed while serving on the planning committee for the upcoming World Summit of Educators. “Ken and I really wanted to maximize the SUA participation in 2021, so we proposed the Youth Summit,” Taka said. Ken said a major inspiration came from the 2021 Peace Proposal issued Jan. 26 by SUA founder Daisaku Ikeda. “Value Creation in a Time of Crisis” included a beyond COVID-19 youth summit, “a convening of young people to discuss the kind of world they would like to see in the aftermath of this crisis.” “The Youth Summit testifies to the voices of the students,” Ken said. “So many young people are severely affected by pandemic and feel powerless, and we wanted to find a way to listen to their underheard voices. We inspire and encourage each other, and with empowerment and solidarity, we can step forward together as one.” The peace proposal educated the student organizers on “the importance of listening to young people in difficult situations, of focusing on people in need who are suffering,” Taka said. “That was eye-opening for me and Ken.” Using an online platform enables the participation of many more young people from diverse backgrounds. At first, the goal seemed enormous to the 20 student organizers. They designed monthly online dialogues that began in January as a way to gain confidence and experience in event planning, as well as encourage education among their peers. Each dialogue’s theme was one of the four pillars of education for global citizenship: developmental education, human rights education, environmental education, and peace education. In addition to these theme-based dialogue events, there will be a dialogue event for SUA and other Soka schools around the world. This event is scheduled for May 1 and will be part of the celebration of the 20th anniversary of SUA’s dedication in Aliso Viejo. The vision and hard work of these student organizers is a continuation of the enthusiastic initiative of SUA’s first cohort of graduate students in the MA in Educational Leadership and Societal Change program, said SUA Vice President for Institutional Research and Assessment Tomoko Takahashi. The graduate students conceived and formed the first World Summit of Educators in 2016. “We didn’t tell them that we are doing a world summit, they came to us with that idea,” she recalled. Pride rises in her voice when she talks about the current student creators of the Youth Summit. “These students drove this new youth summit and came up with the ideas for it,” said Takahashi, a co-chair of the World Summit of Educators. “They are so professional. They really are future leaders. We don’t have to tell them what to do because they are self-initiating and self-motivating. They are very active, forward looking and they always want to do more. “Our students are living our university mission, to lead contributive lives for society, the university, and other students. That’s their motivation.” Envisioning and planning a major event has sparked personal growth for the organizers. For Taka, the summit confirms his choice to earn his master’s degree at SUA. Undergraduate studies at Soka University, Japan, fostered his immense curiosity to see how Soka education “was implemented in other societies,” he said. “That is my biggest motivation to pursue my master’s degree here. Secondly, I want to connect with people who share the same passion for making changes in society through the field of education.” The Youth Summit student committee’s 20 members each have their own responsibilities and leadership roles. Although busy with classes, assignments, and extracurricular activities, they are dedicating their time and energy to meet weekly, making progress toward their vision of creating a space where young people can gather, listen to the voices of others, and empower each other. For Ken, who came to SUA from Japan after a “life-changing” education at an English language school operated by SUA alumnus Nitesh Sil ’11, organizing the summit has affirmed his choice of college. “I’m feeling so much appreciation for the World Summit of Educators committee,” Ken said. “I’m really grateful for this opportunity to connect with people in different backgrounds.” Ken said committee members especially look forward to presenting their report to the World Summit of Educators. “That’s the place where we can convey the voices of young people and demonstrate our determination to make changes,” he said.

The pandemic disrupted their plans. But for the first time in the prestigious program’s history, it has offered appointments in consecutive years and Pierce and Carlisle have each received a second appointment. The Fulbright program, established in 1946, annually offers about 1,200 fellowships to US students, aiming to facilitate cultural exchange between US citizens and those in other countries. Pierce, whose concentration was Environmental Studies, was offered a fellowship to teach English in Spain and Carlisle, whose concentration was Social and Behavioral Sciences, was awarded a fellowship to conduct research in Nanjing, China. The programs typically last a full academic year, from September until June. When the pandemic hit in early 2020, the US State Department, which administers the program, postponed or canceled fellowships depending on the COVID-19 conditions in countries. In Spain, Fulbright postponed its start until January 2021, reducing the program to five months. Pierce was assigned to the Canary Islands, teaching English to children from 3 years old to sixth grade. In April, Pierce learned she was awarded a second fellowship and will return to Spain this fall to complete a full-length teaching assistant program. “I’m looking forward to working with the kids again,” she said. “This experience made me realize that teaching is my calling and it is what I want to do for the rest of my life. It was really great to have that affirmation–that I’m doing what I’m meant to be doing and I love it.” After the conclusion of next year’s program, she hopes to teach either in Spain or the US. Carlisle headed to China to research how music can enhance peacebuilding and reconciliation efforts, a subject he began investigating during his capstone project and his study abroad experience in China. When Carlisle’s program in Nanjing was cut short due to COVID-19, he reached out to an author he’d cited in his capstone, Lesley Pruitt, a political science lecturer at University of Melbourne. By connecting with Pruitt via Zoom, he gained her support for his proposed research. Carlisle said he’s excited to continue his research in February 2022 and expects to work with Gillian Howell, dean’s research fellow at the University of Melbourne’s Faculty of Fine Arts and Music in Australia. “I am most looking forward to conducting research about how music and dance can enhance peacebuilding and truth and reconciliation efforts, in a country where truth, reconciliation, diversity and inclusion, are national initiatives supported by the government,” Carlisle said. “Unlike the United States, the Australian government has made it a national priority to advance truth and reconciliation between it’s aboriginal communities and the descendants of European settlers. “And furthermore, with there being growing immigration to Australia from East Asia, South East Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, there are a growing number of organizations doing work in the field of anti-racism. Therefore, I am curious to see if and how peacebuilding and truth and reconciliation initiatives in Australia may differ from those in the United States.” US citizens, current Soka students or alumni, interested in applying for the Fulbright program in the future can contact Prof. Sarah England, director of the Soka Fulbright advising program for more information. —Nagisa Smalheiser ’21", "categories": ["Fulbright", "International Studies", "Social and Behavioral Sciences", "Alumni", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "June 01, 2021", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Fifty-one years after that conversation, a new university opened on 103 acres in the coastal hills of Southern California on May 3, 2001. In the two decades since, SUA has graduated more than 1,500 students from 57 countries and been ranked as one of the top 30 liberal arts colleges in the country. It has opened the Soka Performing Arts Center and Marie and Pierre Curie Hall, and recently established the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and the Center for Race, Ethnicity, and Human Rights. In recognition of SUA’s achievements and to recommit to its founding principles, more than 3,000 people gathered online May 2 for the university’s 20th anniversary celebration . Co-hosts Corina Giselle ’15 and Zane Romano ’09 led participants through a 90-minute event live from SUA’s Aliso Viejo campus, featuring SUA’s leadership, students, alumni, donors, and, in a special highlight, President Edward Feasel reading a congratulatory message from SUA’s founder. “Thanks to the noble dedication of the honorable students, graduates, faculty and staff, and all of the supporters of Soka Education, Soka University of America is now receiving a great deal of attention and praise as a “model of education for global citizenship,” Mr. Ikeda wrote. “As a founder, there is no greater joy than this. As the world faces unprecedented trials, SUA’s mission to challenge and build a century based on the sanctity of life with an unwavering philosophy and solidarity is growing. With the next 10 years as a goal, please build a new history of value creation for SUA based on strong bonds. Together, let’s emit the eternal ‘light of hope’ in the future of our community!” After a brief video recounting the university’s history, members of the Acjachemen nation, the original inhabitants and stewards of the land on which SUA was built, shared a traditional blessing song with the community as they did at its dedication in 2001. President Feasel opened his remarks with the news that the City of Aliso Viejo and the County of Orange declared May 3, 2021 “Soka University of America Day.” The California State Assembly, California Senate, and Congress also passed resolutions and proclamations in recognition of the historic day. Reflecting on the current state of the world, President Feasel said SUA’s ethic of global citizenship was much needed. “Let’s set the example and share with the world that each person’s lived experience serves as an equally rich opportunity for us to expand our knowledge and love for humanity,” he said. “Through celebrating and learning from the diverse identities of the world, we can also deepen our intrinsically held value for the dignity and sanctity of every life and in this way create what our university founder Daisaku Ikeda has called ‘the brilliant glory of human harmony.’ “I believe this internal growth within each individual is critical at this time and my goal is that in the next 10 years SUA will become the acknowledged leader and champion of education for global citizenship throughout the world,” President Feasel said. To that end, President Feasel thanked the many donors around the world for their generous support of SUA through the years and announced a $1 million matching grant from the John Stauffer Charitable Trust to provide summer research fellowships to SUA students in chemistry and biochemistry. The Nieves Family Foundation also will establish student and faculty summer research grants, President Feasel said, and SUA is launching a fundraising campaign for diversity scholarships. Board of Trustees Chair Stephen Dunham then announced the endowment of a new Daisaku Ikeda Endowed Chair to support faculty excellence, and the naming of SUA’s undergraduate liberal arts program as Daisaku Ikeda College . As Giselle introduced a video excerpt of Mr. Ikeda’s 1996 speech,“Thoughts on Education for Global Citizenship,” delivered at Teachers College, she noted that members of the community repeatedly refer to it as they develop SUA’s curriculum and other aspects of campus life. On the world stage, the Soka Global Citizen Award established earlier this year is another manifestation of Mr. Ikeda’s ideas. President Feasel bestowed the inaugural award to Ambassador Anwarul K. Chowdhury in recognition of his life’s work and achievements for peace and women’s rights. Accepting the honor via video, Ambassador Chowdhury recalled that his 2005 commencement speech—SUA’s first—emphasized “that the work for peace is a continuous process,” in which each of us can make a difference. Chowdhury said teaching his SUA course, “The Culture of Peace,” for more than a decade has “wonderfully blended with the university’s mission and encouraged me to continue to share my life’s education, experience and expertise with its most admirable students,” he said. “The culture of peace and global citizenship are mutually contributive and enhancing.” In honor of his late wife Mariam and her love for the university and its mission, Chowdury proposed using the $25,000 associated with the award to continue her legacy at SUA. The 20th anniversary event continued with a presentation about the new Life Sciences concentration, with a faculty-guided tour of the new labs in the 91,000-square-foot Marie and Pierre Curie Hall. Introducing the video, Romano noted that SUA has “entered into a new era in which students interested in pursuing professions within the field of life science are able to receive their foundational education with global citizenship at the core.” Students are the heart of the university, and to celebrate their diverse talents and backgrounds, members of the orchestra and jazz ensemble clubs performed the student-created SUA student song,“On The Path of Peace,” from their own homes. Three students from Honduras, Nepal, and Zambia reflected on their SUA experience, and Soka Student Union president Shunji Fueki announced that students are compiling a book, Dear Global Citizens, that includes Mr. Ikeda’s messages through the years and will be published this summer. In testament to the power of Soka Education to transform individual lives as well as society, alumna Jennifer Ohrstrom ‘08 shared how its lessons and community have guided her through her journey with Lyme disease. “Though I faced repeated setbacks, I returned again and again to the promise of Soka Education: that each of us has a profound mission for peace, infinite power, and the potential to be happy,” Ohrstrom said. “When I decided to use my life to encourage others the way they had encouraged me though my circumstances were unchanged, I began to cultivate deep joy and appreciation…I learned the value of all the immeasurable but most important things in life: the matters of the heart.” In closing the memorable evening, Giselle said the 20th anniversary celebration has inspired her to recommit to the university’s ideals. “From today again, I will be a person who embodies wisdom, courage, and compassion—the heart of a global citizen and to be a light of hope in my community.”", "categories": ["Soka at 20", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "May 26, 2021", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Karki spoke about his journey in one of three student videos presented during Soka’s 20th Anniversary celebration in May. Karki, who is concentrating on social and behavioral sciences, recalled that he almost failed out of high school in his native Nepal and had to retake his exams. “I lost faith in myself and convinced myself that I’m not cut out for academia,” he said. “The sad reality of education in Nepal is that for the most part, if you think you can’t do anything else, you become a teacher.” In Karki’s case, teaching at a primary school in a rural area—a three hours uphill journey on foot from the nearest bus station—inspired his eventual return to his own education. Working with the “very curious children” rekindled his own curiosity, he said. Before that could happen, an earthquake devastated Nepal. Karki helped with the rescue and rehabilitation efforts, and then became a social mobilizer with a project aimed at ending gender-based violence and establishing gender equality. “I witnessed a lot of disturbing incidents of violence against women, which still gives me PTSD from time to time,” Karki said. “But at the same time, it also makes me feel good that we were able to rescue six women, and help 30 others start their own small businesses.” Karki then knew he wanted to find a college whose mission was related to creating more equitable and peaceful societies, which led him to SUA. “One needs wisdom to see the vices of society, courage to speak against it, and compassion to help those who are suffering,” he said, referring to SUA’s founding principles. Pushing through his doubts and enrolling in SUA was one of the best decisions of his life, said Karki. With the help of Soka financial aid, he was able to focus on his education. Some of the money he earned while working on campus, combined with contributions from friends, have been used to fund a young survivor’s education in Nepal. “I think you reach a point in your life where somebody else’s achievements make you way happier compared to your own achievements,” he said. “I am forever grateful to Soka’s education, which is not only impacting the lives of its students, but also many others in many indirect ways.” Karki will be an intern this summer with Google’s information technology team, which he said isn’t as different from social work as it might seem. “I think IT is very similar to social work because it’s also about troubleshooting and finding solutions to other people’s problems,” Karki said. “And just like social work, it gives me immense pleasure and satisfaction when I can finally solve someone’s issues.” Karki hopes to use the interdisciplinary knowledge he’s gained at Soka to fight social injustices such as gender-based violence. “Having almost given up on life and education, I feel very lucky to have come this far,” he said. “I hope my story can inspire others to never give up. It’s never too late to do anything.”", "categories": ["Undergraduate Academics", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "June 01, 2021", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

This semester-long program features 10 high-level workshops, opportunities to network and team with UCI students, pitch business ideas for up to $20,000 in cash prizes, and B2B participants may earn a certificate of completion for their resume or LinkedIn. To learn more, watch a program overview video from Breanna Hale, executive director of the UCI program or email b2b@soka.edu . Cotton is one of the least environmentally harmful sources of fiber used to make fabric. But every year, farming cotton releases 220 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and 132 million metric tons of coal and up to nine trillion liters of water are used manufacturing cotton fabrics. With climate change contributing to an increasing number of natural disasters every year, better options are urgently needed. A team of four Soka University students has a potential solution. The idea by Anthea Mudanye ’23, Anthony Eduafo ’23, Emmanuel Fiagbe ’24, and Hamza Ibrahim ’23 won top prize at this year’s Bridges to Business Impactathon for their proposal to replace cotton fiber with the stems of banana plants. Banana plants require less water, are grown without chemical fertilizers, and emit much less carbon dioxide. The Tooke Project, named for the Luganda word for banana, would employ Ugandan women to make the more sustainable fabric. The fourth annual Impactathon, an entrepreneurial workshop and business pitch competition, was held from January 8-10 over Zoom, allowing participants and judges from around the world to connect. Hosted by Soka’s Bridges to Business program , Impactathon brought together nine teams, each including at least one SUA student or alumnus, to develop their ideas and business models. Led by Neetal Parekh, founder and CEO of Innov8social , the workshop pushed participants to map social problems, brainstorm impact-driven solutions, and design business plans. Participants also attended “impact talks” by successful social entrepreneurs in the areas of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and public health in addition to working on their own projects. At the end of the weekend, ideas were pitched to potential investors, advisors, and mentors who provided feedback and awarded cash prizes. Judges included Walt Disney’s DEI Manager Brian Walker, DEI workshop facilitator and career coach Corbin Picket, skritswap founder & CEO Melissa Kargiannakis, public health professional Ramon Llamas, and serial entrepreneur Shayan Mashatian. They evaluated each of the ideas based on problem identification, potential for social impact, and inclusivity. The Tooke Project hit all those marks. The students, who are concentrating in Social and Behavioral Sciences and International Studies at Soka, each brought a different perspective to the table. Eduafo is passionate about alleviating environmental pollution in the world and volunteers for LDG Ghana, a non-profit in his home country that seeks to achieve the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. As a woman growing up in Uganda, Mudanye has seen how women, particularly widows, are treated differently and not able to achieve economic stability or financial literacy. Ibrahim, who is from Ghana, has also personally witnessed how widows are mistreated and dehumanized after their husbands die, and is motivated to help fight against this cruel inequity. Fiagbe also grew up in Ghana and loves fashion but when he learned that the industry is the second-largest global polluter he was determined to address the issue. “With my team, we came up with a business plan that would make fast fashion sustainable,” Fiagbe said. “The Impactathon gave me the avenue to look within and ask myself a very important question: How will I create actionable change doing something I love?” The group brainstormed solutions that appealed to each of their interests and came up with the proposed project to employ widowed Ugandan women to create sustainable fabric. Uganda is currently the second-biggest producer of banana fiber, after India. While some companies already make banana fiber textiles, primarily in India, the Tooke Project’s solution would bring down costs of production. The team has not yet decided how to spend its $1,000 prize, but they are participating in UC Irvine’s New Venture competition this semester to continue developing the idea. —Nagisa Smalheiser ’21", "categories": ["Bridges to Business", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "February 09, 2021", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

The Beall Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship at UC Irvine’s Paul Merage School of Business is a hub of activity, education, and networking for entrepreneurs and innovators. Each year it hosts a startup competition in which students, staff, researchers, and community members form teams and compete for $100,000 in cash prizes and professional services. This year’s New Venture Competition drew 85 teams and SUA students participated on teams that swept the top three places in the semifinals of the Social Enterprise category. Two teams advanced to the finals and finished in first and second place in the group. Anjan Rana Magar ’23, who is concentrating on Environmental Studies, was a member of the winning project, Circular , which received a $7,500 award for its idea to disrupt the cycle of food waste and hunger. Magar, the startup’s environmental director, joined with a UC Irvine facilities engineer and two UCI MBA students, to develop a service that picks up food waste from restaurants, composts the waste with earthworms, and uses to it fertilize a vertical farm growing organic produce, which is then distributed back to its partner restaurants. Four Soka students developed the idea for second-place winner, Tooke Fabrics, which proposes creating sustainable fabric from raw materials used in banana production. The team — Anthea Mudanye ’23, Anthony Eduafo ’23, Hamza Ibrahim ’23, and Emmanuel Fiagbe ’24 — received $2,500 from the UCI competition. The team previously won $1,000 in Soka’s Impactathon in January. Tooke Fabrics aims to replace cotton fiber with the stems of banana plants. Banana plants require less water, are grown without chemical fertilizers, and emit much less carbon dioxide. Tooke, named for the Luganda word for banana, would employ Ugandan women to make the more sustainable fabric. Another Soka entrant, Marlen Riviere’s Bconomy, finished third in the New Venture Competition’s semifinals, ahead of seven other entrants. Riviere, who concentrated on International Studies and graduated this year, is continuing work on a concept to create an opportunity for Black-owned businesses and conscious consumers to connect through an online app and website platform. “Witnessing the personal and professional growth of these Soka students as they embraced the demands of the competition workshops was beyond inspiring,” said Mary Patrick Kavanaugh, director of Soka’s Bridges to Business program , which helps students and alumni connect their liberal arts education into the world of social impact, entrepreneurship, and business. “They moved through their doubts, fears, and overloaded schedules like true changemakers,” Kavanaugh said. In addition to their academic workload, they attended UCI workshops, dreamt up ideas that have measurable social impact, built teams, practiced with mentors, and pitched concepts to investors. “Anyone watching the final pitches could see that they also infused them with humor and enthusiasm,” she said. “Congratulations to Tooke Fabrics and Circular for winning startup funding, and a special shout out to Bconomy for coming so close.” —Nagisa Smalheiser ’21", "categories": ["Bridges to Business", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "June 01, 2021", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

{"newspaper": "soka-news", "url": "https://www.soka.edu/news-events/news/grateful-leonard-bogdonoff-13-sua-was-success-accelerator", "title": "For a Grateful Leonard Bogdonoff ’13, SUA Was a Success Accelerator", "text": "There was a time when Leonard Bogdonoff ’13 couldn’t have imagined being an SUA alumnus, much less being asked to address the university community at one of its premier events. As he recounted his journey from struggling high school student to tech entrepreneur at the 17th annual Celebrating a Vision of Peace gala, Bogdonoff reminded attendees of the power each of them has to contribute to a young person’s success. Always a special night for SUA, this year’s Peace Gala felt particularly meaningful as 176 community members were able to celebrate in person at the Athenaeum. The event was also streamed online with SUA supporters attending from around the US and countries including Brazil, Guatemala, Ireland, Israel, and Vietnam. The Oct. 9 event raised $797,908 for the student scholarship fund. Calling the evening a “heartwarming” experience, Bogdonoff said he was honored to be part of it. “I recognize the technology field is a small subset of alumni today,” he said, “but I do feel the range of fields that graduates pursue speaks more for how SUA’s educational opportunities prepare students to establish a new path in the world.” “I can wholeheartedly say if it was not for the financial support I received through the scholarships made possible by donors like you, I would have neither graduated college nor married my wife, Jihii (Jihii Jolly Bogdonoff ’11)… I would have never met my business partner, who I happened to meet nine years ago during my study abroad. And I would not have had, or have, the countless lifelong friends who I cherish beyond all else and depend on daily.” Following SUA President Edward Feasel’s welcome, Bogdonoff opened his remarks by posing a question a professor had once asked him: “If you had to spend the rest of your life pursuing one of the following three virtues, which would you choose? Your options are fame, wealth, and power.” Bogdonoff’s path to his own answer has not been a straight one. Despite the support and opportunities provided by his parents, Akiko and Jesse, Bogdonoff struggled through his high school years. He was arrested for juvenile misconduct and eventually expelled. At the same time, his family faced financial setbacks that resulted in bankruptcy. Bogdonoff’s family had donated to SUA’s founding, and after they moved from San Francisco to Southern California, his mother began working on campus. With the encouragement of his parents and the SUA community, Bogdonoff applied and was accepted to SUA’s seventh class, but his challenges with academics continued. Completing assignments on time was difficult, in part because writing was a struggle. After two semesters, he left SUA and enrolled in a community college. Bogdonoff said an SUA alumnus who knew his situation made “continuous efforts to encourage me and challenged me to deepen my own sense of purpose about my life.” His grades improved and the next year he was able to return to SUA. Bogdonoff’s return to campus was more successful. His grades improved steadily, rising enough for him to become eligible for scholarships. “It was only because of the generous academic scholarship SUA offered, made possible by donors that I was able to continue my college degree,” he said. “My time at SUA was marked with numerous cornerstones that shifted how I thought about myself and the impact I could make in the world,” he said. “I had countless professors who helped recognize strengths in myself that I had never seen, and encouraged me by coming up with opportunities to develop them inside and out of class.” One example: Though SUA had no courses in design or software development, a professor aware of his interest asked him to build a website. He began finding resources and learned about design and software, which helped him prepare for the career he pursued after graduation. The support of SUA faculty and staff helped him embrace his unique learning style and learn to effectively structure his thoughts, which improved his writing. “Paper after paper, I got more confident with writing, which culminated in my capstone project on a then-obscure online community called Reddit,” he said, “for which my professor allowed me to deeply research the business of online products, the history of internet communities, and the startup tech industry.” After graduating in 2013, Bogdonoff moved to New York and began working as a software engineer at Conde Nast, where he worked on the New Yorker , and then as an innovation specialist with the US federal government. He followed those assignments with a stint at a machine learning startup, and moved on to Google, where he was part of a team responsible for serving fonts and typography rendered on billions of devices a day. During the pandemic, Bogdonoff began building a video tool. He launched a company, Milk Video , and this year participated in Y Combinator, a prestigious startup accelerator through which he raised a $1.5 million seed round from investors and founders of many successful companies. His New York company now has five full-time employees and is serving customers ranging from public corporations to startups with billion dollar valuations. Bogdonoff said his “experience as a student engaging with people from around the world gave me the confidence to meet new people, research unknown fields with ease and even win trust from strangers to collaborate and eventually raise money to start a venture-capital-backed business.” While starting a company has been a long-time dream, Bogdonoff said his “deeper goal is to contribute directly to the many fields that are not financially rewarded for the value they create in the world,” and to support SUA’s growth to help it “become a household name for generations to be associated with fostering humanitarian peacemakers, cultural leaders from around the world, and timeless educators.” Returning to the question he posed at the start of his remarks, Bogdonoff said that while all three of the goals—wealth, fame, and power—have become synonymous with selfishness, they can be reframed to maximize the good they can do for others. “For example, wealth is not the cultivation of riches for buying more houses or cars, but a way to amass value and direct it to the areas in society that are not financially rewarded for the value they create,” he said. “Similarly, fame is not about short-term recognition or special privileges, but instead the aspiration to spend your life making contributions to the world, which will be valued for generations to come. “And in the light of value creation, I believe power is less about political ambition, manipulation, trade-offs, and corruption, but instead can be harnessed by people with conviction behind their beliefs to fix things they see as wrong in society’s broken cultural frameworks, especially for the sake of those who can’t fix it for themselves.”", "categories": ["Alumni", "Peace Gala", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "November 03, 2021", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},
{"newspaper": "soka-news", "url": "https://www.soka.edu/news-events/news/community-dialogue-explores-suas-founding-principles", "title": "A Community Dialogue Explores SUA’s Founding Principles", "text": "Two decades after SUA opened and in the midst of an uncertain and divisive time in the world, the university community gathered online to discuss founder Daisaku Ikeda’s ideas and putting them into action on campus and beyond. “A Community Dialogue on Creating a Culture of Global Citizenship at SUA,” featured a presentation by Jason Goulah, professor and director of the Institute for Daisaku Ikeda Studies in Education at DePaul University in Chicago and member of SUA’s Board of Trustees, followed by a panel of community representatives reflecting on his comments and small-group discussions. The April 2 event was organized by the 20th Anniversary Engagement Subcommittee. Goulah, who has been researching Ikeda’s work since the 1990s, noted that education has been at the core of Ikeda’s wide-ranging thinking since he published his first essay in 1949. Those ideas have led to the founding of 13 schools, two universities, and a women’s college in seven countries. Ikeda views education as “the unparalleled font of true human becoming and genuine, almost existential, happiness,” said Goulah. The happiness Ikeda is referring to isn’t hedonistic pleasure or nihilistic satisfaction, he said, but “the courage, appreciation, hope and joy born from realizing one’s unlimited capacity to create meaning from both learning and life’s realities.” In Ikeda’s view, “being born human does not make one a human being,” quoted Goulah. It requires what Ikeda calls ningen kyōiku, or “human education,” and the tenacious application of its principles. That people need human education to become human beings cannot be overemphasized in terms of its importance in Ikeda’s approach to education, said Goulah. Goulah distilled Ikeda’s approach to human education into the four interlocking commitments of dialogue, global citizenship, value creation, and creative coexistence. As SUA’s mission is to foster a steady stream of global citizens committed to living contributive lives, Goulah focused the remainder of his talk on the development and impact of Ikeda’s notion of global citizenship. Ikeda’s continued focus on the principle of global citizenship is influenced by the work of Japanese educators Tsunesaburo Makiguchi and Josei Toda, as well as his personal experiences. In 1903, Makiguchi proposed the idea of “world people” as part of education that fosters a sense of belonging and commitment to one’s local community, country, and the world. Nearly three decades later, he conceived of a sōka, or “value-creating,” pedagogy, the essence of which, Goulah states, “Ikeda has advanced globally and memorialized as the foundational ethos and namesake of the Soka schools and universities he founded.” Toda, Ikeda’s mentor, also promoted a cosmopolitan ethic with his unique concept of chikyū minzoku shugi, or what has been translated as “one-worldism.” “We see Ikeda repeatedly engaging with the principle of global citizenship, always deepening our understanding of its characteristics and illuminating its importance not only for ameliorating life’s most pressing issues, but also for fully developing ourselves as human beings,” said Goulah. “He is constantly revisiting it, reframing and making it current and necessary for the times.” Ikeda frequently connects the idea of global citizenship to the realities of our time in history. On a visit to Chicago in the 1960s, Ikeda witnessed an incident of racial injustice in Lincoln Park. “He invoked the ethic of global citizenship in that moment,” said Goulah, seeing its potential “to abolish racial discrimination, unjust treatment and the prejudice rooted deeply in people’s hearts.” Another example: Ikeda, who also is a poet, invoked the ethic of global citizenship in a poem in response to the race riots sparked by the 1991 beating of Rodney King by Los Angeles police officers. Speaking at Teachers College, Columbia University in 1996, in what is often considered the founding lecture of SUA, Ikeda identified three characteristics of global citizenship—wisdom, courage, and compassion. While the development of wisdom and compassion can also be seen in other thinkers’ notions of global citizenship, Goulah said Ikeda’s inclusion of courage is unique and important. Wisdom and compassion will not be enough if we don’t have the courage to enact them in our lives. “Our own capacity for global citizenship is fundamentally hindered by fear,” said Goulah. Ikeda understands that it takes courage “to develop a practice of speaking to the complex individual human being right in front of us and challenge the spirit of abstracting people into monolithic groups.” At the conclusion of his remarks, Goulah summed up how we can leverage Ikeda’s interlocking ideas and ideals to create value in our shared world. “With dialogue as our lodestar, creative coexistence and a better age are always possible at every moment, especially with young people at the forefront,” said Goulah. “The power to transform the times comes always from achieving a transformation right where you are. How can I, in my own way, as I am, right here where I am, and with the people in front of me, cultivate the wisdom, courage, and compassion of a global citizen? Asking this question is an ongoing invitation for all of us.” Following the presentation, a panel of three members of the SUA community explored how SUA’s mission is expressed on campus before participants gathered in small groups for further discussion. Karen Moran Jackson, assistant professor of educational psychology and assessment, noted that while we think about a school as a place of cognitive development, it can “also be a place of empathy development, and developing an understanding of your emotional capacity for yourself and for connecting with others.” She invited participants to consider ways to make conversations that foster connection as part of everyday life on campus and in classrooms. For Jacqueline Cid, assistant director of student organizations and inclusion programs, developing the wisdom, compassion, and courage Ikeda defined is not without challenges. “How do you have the courage to not fear or deny differences? For me, it’s an internal process,” she said. “And asking myself how do I engage with folks who are hurting or in pain, or in a place of confusion. It is knowing I am in a place where I can have those conversations and be respectful when someone else is not.” Subina Thapaliya ‘22 said encouragement from her professors and the examples of other students have helped her transform since she arrived at SUA from Nepal. Thapaliya initially was self-conscious when she was the only person with her background in a situation, and felt awkward about what she didn’t know as well as pressured to represent her culture. “With time, my appreciation of the unique views brought to the table by my friends, each of whom had a unique background, inspired me to bring ideas from my own,” she said. “My appreciation of the unique individuality of my friends even released me from the burden of being under pressure all the time to represent my identity. I became comfortable being myself, and it helped me see the person in front of me as a unique individual devoid of any identity tags that they resemble.”", "categories": ["Soka at 20", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "April 20, 2021", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Before that opportunity, Ng, who is the sustainability coordinator at Scripps College, wasn’t sure where her interest in protecting the environment would lead her after graduation. “My job is definitely drawing from what I did at SUA,” Ng said. “One thing that I like to tell people about my experience as an undergrad is that I am really glad I had the opportunity to work really closely with faculty.” As a high school student in Modesto, Calif., Ng discovered SUA when researching colleges online. From the start, she liked what she saw. Her family, however, hadn’t heard of the college and weren’t sure it was the right choice. Ng followed her instincts, and after a visit to campus she was certain. “I thought it was a really cool university,” she said. “I liked its mission and the types of courses SUA offered. I just kind of went on a limb and applied, and I’m glad I did.” She admits it was also hard to explain to her family and friends how she’d turn her passion for the environment into a career, in part because she wasn’t clear about her direction herself. “There are so many options because the field is so broad,” she said. “I think the way that I’ve been interested in the environment has changed, but I’ve never not been interested in it. I’m constantly learning more about it.” In spring of 2017, Ng and three other students worked with M. Robert Hamersley, assistant dean of faculty, professor of biogeochemistry, and director of the science lab, on an independent study. The project was ambitious–taking a full assessment of SUA’s potential environmental impact. The assessment was used for SUA to participate in the Sustainability Tracking Assessment and Rating System (STARS), which is used by colleges and universities to measure and benchmark their impact. Ng enjoyed the experience enough that after graduation, she participated in a 10-month program through Strategic Energy Innovations in which people are paired with an organization to do similar evaluations. She worked at the University of California, San Francisco, getting a glimpse of sustainability efforts at a much larger institution. Ng said the University of California’s goal to cut carbon emissions as well as the funding it can offer to researchers in the field are two examples of how much impact the state university system can have on the environment. Ng’s experiences at SUA and UC were key to landing her job at Scripps, she said. While she is not the first to hold the position at Scripps, one of the Claremont Colleges, it had been left unfilled during the first year of the pandemic. Ng, who started in September, said her role requires a bit of detective work, as she has spent much of her time reviewing documents and learning what her predecessor had done. Ng does greenhouse gas accounting, in which she looks at the purchases the college makes and their impact on the environment. That includes everything from utilities-purchased electricity and natural gas, to the indirect emissions from employee commutes and study abroad travel. “It’s nice that at a smaller college you have your own ecosystem, and in some ways changes are easier to make,” she said. “In other ways it is harder to have impact because you don’t have the scale.” Ng expects one day to attend graduate school, but working with colleges offers a lot of satisfaction for her now. Colleges understand the importance of monitoring their environmental impact not only to address climate change, but because prospective students are increasingly demanding it. “There’s a strong consciousness around sustainability and students expect it from their schools,” Ng said. “Sustainability is an important factor in their decisions.”", "categories": ["Alumni", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "December 09, 2021", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Feasel welcomed them to the Soka University community with a video message that was particularly compelling during this challenging year. President Feasel encouraged students to start their journeys to embodying SUA founder Daisaku Ikeda’s three essential elements of global citizenship: wisdom, courage, and compassion. “I believe Soka is just the beginning, and at SUA you are embarking on this lifelong process of personal development and inner transformation,” President Feasel said. “This inner transformation is the process of bringing forth the three qualities of a global citizen that are innate in everyone’s life. Based on this, you can take action in society to contribute to the well-being of others.” It was the first day of a Welcome Week like no other. The Class of 2024 includes the largest percentage of international students in SUA’s history—54%—with students from countries including Canada, China, Ghana, Honduras, Indonesia, Mexico, Nepal, Nigeria, Russia, and Vietnam. (The Soka Graduate School Class of 2022 represents a similar global reach, with its four students coming from the US, Malaysia, Japan, and Canada.) When it became clear students would not be starting their college years on campus, the orientation committee concentrated on a three-part strategy: providing students with all the academic information they needed, reinforcing SUA’s founding principles, and exploring issues of diversity, equality, and inclusion. “During this year with so many challenges—not only the Covid-19 pandemic but the reckoning with racial justice—we knew we needed to more deeply share our founding principles, which go to respecting people and the ties that bring us together,” said Dean of Students Hyon J. Moon. Planning for the week, which began August 9, required an all-hands-on-deck approach, said Director of Student Services Brian Durick. “With so much changing, we not only had to move everything online but figure out how to make it accessible for every student,” Durick said. A trove of materials on courses, majors, registration and the like was collected online for students to access at any time. Welcome Week events were then scheduled twice a day in each time zone, and nine Student Orientation Leaders (SOLs) were assigned small groups of students based on those zones. The week kicked off with welcome messages from campus leaders and sessions on academics, including Q&As with faculty that Durick said allowed students to get a broad view of course options, majors, and even the career paths they might one day follow. To begin students’ journeys to global citizenship, orientation included the launch of a six-part series exploring SUA’s founding ideals. Jason Goulah, a member of the Soka University Board of Trustees and professor of bilingual-bicultural education and director of the Institute for Daisaku Ikeda Studies and Education at DePaul University, opened the series with an explanation of Ikeda philosophies. After his talk, students discussed the ideas in their small groups. “The sessions helped students learn about SUA’s principles and bring their own insights to them,” said Durick, adding that students reported they appreciated the opportunity to share their thoughts on the ideas, many for the first time. Those conversations set the stage for a new initiative aimed at developing a deeper understanding of diversity, equality, and inclusion. The seven-part series, I Am: We Are Diversity , was created in response to student requests that SUA do more to address those issues on campus and in society. As the topics can be sensitive to discuss, planning for the series included setting guidelines for conversations and having a counselor available if a student wanted to speak privately. Michelle Hobby-Mears, associate dean of students and director of Residential Life and Student Activities, and guest instructors led sessions that explored topics including identity and culture, unconscious bias, courage in storytelling, humanistic dialogue, and building community. “The entire series for first-year students was designed to provide a foundation from which students can further explore diversity, equity, and inclusion as well as their role in the community and as future global citizens,” Hobby-Mears said. Several of the sessions will also be offered to upper division students this academic year. The importance of the conversations, and the largely positive response from students who participated, also cemented the idea that the series will be an annual requirement for first-year students. Each year, student orientation leaders plan social events to help first-year students begin getting to know their classmates. Finding ways to do so online was this year’s challenge, but Durick said the SOLs rose to the occasion with creative approaches from clever icebreakers to online games. Maxine Xu, a junior from Irvine, California, became a SOL to give back to the community that had given her so much already. “All the SOLs did their best to make sure that the first-years feel that they matter, belong, and can succeed,” she said. “The biggest challenge the SOLs faced was designing bonding activities that were feasible for the students while simultaneously encouraging camaraderie and community virtually. We wanted to create an environment where students didn’t feel like they were miles apart.” For her own group, Xu organized a game night and a karaoke night, along with weekly check-ins to gauge how students were adjusting to online learning. “We played charades and Soka Jeopardy and we sang a lot of pop songs from the 2000s,” said Xu. “It was interesting to see that the virtual barrier made the incoming students even more willing to put themselves out there and meet as many of their classmates as they could.” Durick agreed that SUA’s virtual orientation was not only successful, but provided some unexpected benefits. “Students really bonded in the small groups, and we want to do more of those kinds of settings in the future,” he said. “The week had a real focus on discussions, and we were reminded that the purpose of bringing people together isn’t to sit and listen to lectures, but to deeply engage with each other.”", "categories": ["Academics", "Student Life", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "October 05, 2020", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},
{"newspaper": "soka-news", "url": "https://www.soka.edu/news-events/news/soka-launches-new-life-sciences-concentration", "title": "Soka Launches New Life Sciences Concentration", "text": "Soka University of America is officially opening its Life Sciences concentration this fall, offering a unique, research-based science program for undergraduate liberal arts students. Life Sciences at Soka is flexible, the curriculum designed to give students the opportunity to plan their own path. Are you pre-med? Interested in biological fieldwork? Molecular chemistry? Physical therapy? Soka can take you there. And because Soka is starting from scratch, said Susan Walsh, director of the concentration and associate professor of molecular/cell biology, the university has been able to develop a curriculum that teaches core scientific concepts in an efficient and compact way. “We get to think about what students really need,” Walsh said. “And we built all of our learning objectives in conjunction with our assessment, so that we can really have that opportunity to say ‘OK, this is what we want graduates to walk out with.’ ” The science classes are complemented by Soka’s expansive liberal arts offerings and the school’s focus on encouraging global citizenship. Students should leave the program with a humanistic perspective and be as adept at explaining science as they are at practicing it. “It’s not at all a traditional science program,” Walsh said. “We are a liberal arts school and that’s great, because they’ll have the science knowledge that will hopefully help them interpret and understand things like a global pandemic better than the average citizen.” Starting a new concentration during a pandemic isn’t without challenges. Because all fall instruction will be online, students will have to wait to use the teaching laboratories in the new science building, the 91,000-square-foot Marie and Pierre Curie Hall. Meanwhile, Life Science faculty have adjusted, using the fall to set the stage for experiments when students are able to return to campus. In one independent study class Walsh is teaching, four students are each picking a yeast gene and, using a suite of computerized bioinformatic tools, are designing experiments to predict how it will behave. It’s the kind of hands-on research that Soka is emphasizing in the concentration. “Rather than walking into a lab and seeing how enzymes work and doing what is already known,” Walsh said, “let’s come up with a novel problem and actually do the science to figure it out.” Soka is welcoming 23 first-year students into the Life Science concentration this month, joining approximately the same number of rising sophomores who started taking chemistry and biology courses in the 2019-2020 academic year. To fulfill concentration requirements, students will take two foundational courses in chemistry and biology, the latter being co-taught by a biologist and chemist to help students understand the cellular hallmarks of cancer. In addition, they will have two associated laboratory courses in which they will design and complete research projects, and another project-based lab course. Given small class sizes, students will always have specialized attention. Walsh, and the other eight professors in the concentration , designed the curriculum for flexibility while also fulfilling national guidelines for undergraduate science education. It’s also set up to prepare students for the post-graduate paths they hope to pursue in medical health, applied research, biotechnology, and beyond. All Soka Life Science students will spend a significant amount of time in the laboratory, which, in many undergraduate science programs, is optional, not required. “Our students are going to be super well-prepared to go into a laboratory,” Walsh said, “be that a graduate school laboratory, a government laboratory, biotech, or pharma, to do summer internships.” This summer for example, students anticipated doing research in Singapore, Japan, New York, San Francisco, and on campus with SUA faculty, before plans were interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Fittingly, Soka students have made resourceful adjustments. Two have become certified contact tracers in the fight against COVID-19; another got a summer job working in a clinical lab at UC Irvine Medical Center. Rising sophomore Reika Nyunoya was ready to present research in San Diego in April before the pandemic. Instead, Walsh invited her to take her place for an online poster session organized by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Other presenters included graduate students, post-docs and professors. Nyunoya fielded questions on a poster she and other first-year students worked on with Walsh: Genetics in Action: Mutation of Chromoproteins in First-Semester Introductory Biology. “It was a great experience,” Nyunoya said. Other now-second-year students got a taste of hands-on research on campus last academic year. The experience was immersive and engaging and began with their first classes. Saanika Joshi, a rising sophomore who hopes to become a doctor, worked on research project on mutating biofluorescent chromoproteins, learning about data gathering and entry, issues with faulty data, and shortcomings of the experiment as a whole. In her second semester, Joshi worked on harvesting and analyzing DNA from genetic samples from Southern California coastal zones, collected by marine biology students in another class, to see if there is genetic flow between populations. Mikey Venezia ’23 appreciates the personal relationship he has with Life Science professors. Venezia, who was recruited to play soccer at SUA, hopes to combine his passion for sports and medicine and become a chiropractor or physical therapist. He wants to provide the kind of supportive and empathetic care that he felt was lacking when he was recovering from athletic injuries in high school. “Stuff like that can really change your life,” he said. “I think a liberal arts education can help me learn the science, but you also learn the ethical side of how healthcare affects humanity. Not just straight science facts but also taking into account sentiment and empathy.” Like Venezia, an increasing number of students are interested in careers in medical and affiliated health careers. And SUA’s approach to science has already changed the perspective of students like Joshi, who is excited by how a liberal arts education can help her in her medical career. “You’re forced to look deeper into the ethics and psychology and actual human behaviors and connections with people that you make,” she said. “That’s a big part of going into the medical field. You have to interact with people and so anything you can do to better understand those people ultimately helps how you end up treating them.” The program is practical and hands on, yet students are also required to complete Soka’s core curriculum, which covers elements of philosophy, history, writing, and other liberal arts courses. The science training is augmented by a foundation in critical thinking, effective communication, and understanding of how to create social value. For Joshi the Soka spirit was reinforced during a Learning Cluster class trip to Scandinavia last winter to study the Norwegian model of outdoor education. Witnessing the model’s benefit to children’s health gave her another perspective on how lifestyle and policy can influence healthcare and how people should be treated. “And that’s more of a reason for me to go into medicine, to help people who maybe don’t have the opportunity to think about this stuff,” Joshi said. “The same with racial disparities in medicine: how can I as an individual work to eradicate those wherever I go?”", "categories": ["Undergraduate Academics", "Life Sciences", "Soka at 20", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "September 01, 2020", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

The John Stauffer Endowment for Summer Research in Chemistry and Biochemistry will be a one-to-one matching fund that will create a $2 million fund by December 2026, which will enable SUA to offer a summer research program in chemistry and biochemistry. The fund will be used to award research fellowships for current and future chemistry and biochemistry students, benefiting a diverse population of students early in their academic careers, helping to shape career choices and retention in STEM fields. The award comes during the first year of SUA’s new interdisciplinary Life Sciences concentration and the opening of SUA’s new 91,000 square foot science building, Marie and Pierre Curie Hall. “SUA and the members of the SUA faculty are highly committed to a viable undergraduate research program that will have a lasting impact on the future of each participating SUA student,” the Stauffer award letter stated. When fully funded, this endowment will enable SUA to support a cohort of 10 to 12 Stauffer Fellows, students who will conduct advanced research with SUA faculty during the summer. Donations may be made on Soka‘s online giving site. “We are incredibly grateful for this award and the support that the John Stauffer Trust has provided to us at SUA,” said Bryan Penprase, SUA vice president of sponsored research and external academic relations, who led the grant writing effort. “By enabling students to conduct advanced research early in their careers, it will help them gain deeper understanding of current issues in life sciences, and help them advance in their careers.” The John Stauffer Charitable Trust is a private foundation established in 1974 and located in Pasadena, California. John Stauffer was a prominent industrialist and founder of the Stauffer Chemical Company. Through the leadership of the established trust and trustees, John Stauffer’s organizations, programs, and projects continue to be supported in Southern California. The trust has provided similar awards to other leading university and college science programs in Southern California, including California Institute of Technology, Occidental College, University of Redlands, Harvey Mudd College, and Pepperdine University. The award recognizes the quality of SUA’s new Life Sciences program, and the capabilities of its science faculty, who worked with Dr. Penprase on preparing the grant. Those faculty include Zahra Afrasiabi (chemistry) Susan Walsh and Robert Hamersley (biology), Phat Vu (physics), and Robert Levenson and Nidanie Henderson-Stull (chemistry and biochemistry). Shuna McMichael, SUA’s director of sponsored research, also played a key role in helping the team complete the grant proposal. “The Stauffer foundation recognized the quality of our new Life Sciences program and our excellent interdisciplinary SUA science faculty in making this award, and we are very grateful to have this recognition and support as we move forward with our new summer research program,” Dr. Penprase said. “Since our life sciences curriculum emphasizes cutting-edge problems in the life sciences, summer research is essential for preparing students.” The Stauffer Fellowships will give undergraduate students the opportunity to conduct research projects in summer and continue during the academic year. The fellowships will improve the depth of research and the quality of students’ senior capstone research projects. Having the ability to provide an opportunity to conduct research on a more full-time basis in the summer will also increase the number of students who are able to present and publish research, which will increase their chances for admission to quality PhD and MS programs after graduation from SUA. The Life Sciences concentration, officially launched this academic year, includes innovative and interdisciplinary courses that offer students research experiences in their first semester of study. The curriculum features elements such as the Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience or CURE, an integrated biology and chemistry course, and laboratory research course known as the Project-Based Laboratory. “As Soka University celebrates the 20th anniversary of our Aliso Viejo campus in 2021, we are honored that the John Stauffer Charitable Trust has recognized the importance of supporting undergraduate research in the sciences,” SUA President Edward Feasel said. “SUA’s mission is to foster a steady stream of global citizens committed to living a contributive life - people who will give back to their communities and make this world a better place. Summer research opportunities like this will give students a wonderful opportunity to strengthen their skills and explore career options.”", "categories": ["Research", "Life Sciences", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "May 02, 2021", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},
{"newspaper": "soka-news", "url": "https://www.soka.edu/news-events/news/learning-cluster-students-find-meaning-wilderness-orange-county", "title": "Learning Cluster Students Find Meaning in the Wilderness of Orange County", "text": "Twelve Soka students and their professor recently scaled a 4,513-foot mountain and faced a vast expanse of green and silence stretching for miles below. This elevated experience in nature was neither an extracurricular club activity nor a sporting event, but rather the culmination of one of Soka’s unique curricular offerings—the Learning Cluster. Learning Cluster classes are intensive three-and-half-week sessions conducted during winter block. The courses are co-designed by students and faculty and allow a deeper examination of subjects of all kinds. During a four-hour hike to Laguna Beach, Chaerin Her ’24 realized how inspirational the outdoors could be for one’s mind and body. They began formulating an idea for a Learning Cluster class that would center on hiking and the exploration of nature. Word spread, and before long, students who’d heard about their idea began reaching out. When it became clear there was sufficient interest in a Learning Cluster centered on exploring nature, the group approached Robert Hamersley, professor of environmental biogeochemistry, and asked him to lead it. As an outdoorsman who truly enjoys nature, Professor Hamersley readily agreed to the students’ proposal. However, his experience in the wild also heightened his awareness of the challenges associated with taking 12 students on long hikes, especially when some had no previous experience in long-distance hiking. Many meetings were held before the class commenced to carefully plan its structure. Once classes began, students spent time in the Soka Instructional Garden learning how to chop wood with an axe, identify plant species, navigate with a compass, and read topographic maps, among other outdoor survival skills. The classes also incorporated readings and journal writing. Students’ journal entries served as a form of self-research, containing reflections from readings, hikes, and class discussions alongside pictures and other external resources. Parallel to this preparatory phase, students participated in four hiking trips. What began as two- to three-hour-long hikes gradually ramped up to five or six hours. These trips prepared students for the hike at Los Pinos, the fourth highest peak in Orange County, on the second day of a four-day camping trip to Blue Jay Campground in the Santa Ana Mountains, east of the SUA campus, as the culmination of the Learning Cluster. The class split into three groups during the camping trip. Each group was responsible for making its own breakfast and lunch and took turns cooking dinner for the entire class. For many students, this was their first time sleeping in tents, baking bread on coals, and eating marshmallows around a campfire. Although some students were exhausted upon returning to Soka, many reported gaining a new awareness during the trip. “I had no idea that humans could affect nature so much,” said Mark Okuda ’24. “Humans are so tiny, and nature is so big. It is crazy what humans can do. Just bringing a seed that happened to be sticking on our shoe could bring an invasive species, destroying the native plants present.” For the final project, each student presented on a topic of their choice related to nature. Presentation topics included celestial navigation, the mental health benefits of looking at fire, the benefits of natural fragrances, and the overall benefits of being in contact with nature. On the final day of the Learning Cluster, the class reflected on the three weeks. At one point in the discussion Professor Hamersley said, “Comfort is often overrated, and discomfort is often underrated.” Judging by the fondness and humor with which they spoke of the trials and rigors they’d experienced together outdoors, the students clearly agreed. —Nugnandini Chhetri ‘25", "categories": ["Learning Clusters", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "February 24, 2022", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

A marine evolutionary geneticist, Prof. Nydam is the first SUA faculty member to be part of a research project funded by the NSF. Prof. Nydam and two collaborators will use the $662,000 award to expand knowledge of marine invertebrate ascidians, commonly known as sea squirts. “I am fascinated by Marie’s work, which I sometimes describe as a 23andMe for marine invertebrates that unlocks the genetic codes within the creatures and also the pathways by which these creatures migrate across the earth, sometimes aided by human trade,” said Bryan Penprase, vice president for sponsored research and external academic relations. “Marie’s work also is so well connected to Soka’s mission as it helps students understand our common global connections and how nature and humanity are so integrally connected,” he said. “She has done amazing interdisciplinary work in her research and teaching, and has added so much to Soka since she has arrived. We are very proud of her accomplishments and what she has brought to SUA and to our new Life Sciences concentration.” We spoke to Prof. Nydam about her research, her passion for sea life, and teaching at SUA. For those of us who aren’t familiar with sea squirts, tell us about them and why they are interesting subjects for study. Sea squirts are our closest invertebrate relatives and are of great evolutionary, ecological, and economic significance. Ascidians can be used as models to study the evolution of chordates, which include humans and all other vertebrates. As animals that are often introduced to non-native areas in which they thrive, ascidians can alter natural communities and result in considerable economic losses to the aquaculture industry. Also, like other marine invertebrates, sea squirts can be an important source of drugs to treat human diseases. For example, the drug ecteinascidin is used to treat rare cancers called sarcomas. Despite the important role of ascidians in marine communities, many species remain undiscovered. Identifying ascidian species is vital but it is also challenging, as physical differences are often microscopic and the DNA barcode commonly used in animals is not always sufficient. There are currently about 3,500 identified species, while the number of unidentified species is estimated to be about 1,000. These gaps in species diversity and distribution are a significant concern for conservation biology and reserve management. Conservation efforts are most effective when scientists and managers understand the complexities of the communities in a region, and this understanding is predicated on deep knowledge of diversity and abundance. Coral reefs are a particularly vulnerable marine habitat, which is why we are focusing on ascidians in coral reefs for this grant. Describe the research this grant is supporting. This project has three primary objectives. The first is to develop new molecular markers from across the nuclear genome and the ascidian tree of life. Finding a new reliable set of DNA regions will allow researchers to accurately identify ascidian species and address important questions in invasive species spread and chordate evolution. Our second goal is to apply these novel markers to create the first catalog of ascidian diversity in artificial habitats such as harbors and in a natural one—a Belizean reef habitat. This inventory will not only extend our knowledge of ascidian biodiversity and distribution along the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System, but will also document the prevalence of introduced ascidian species and provide identification based on integrated molecular and morphological data for over 40 species never sequenced before. Finally, this project will characterize ascidian gut microbiomes and map variations. Microbes appear to play a significant role in the evolution of chordate hosts. Characterizing the ascidian gut microbiome will shed light on the microbiome’s role in host evolution and the successful establishment of these animals in new habitats. By combining traditional morphology with newly developed molecular markers, then applying this integrative approach to identifying species and investigating microbial symbiosis, this project will significantly advance our understanding of ascidian diversity and phylogenetics, biological invasions, and chordate evolution. How did your collaboration with the other investigators come about? There are only about 200 researchers worldwide who study ascidians, and only a handful who study ascidian evolution. We all know each other from the International Tunicata Meeting, which has been happening every two years since 2000. I collaborated with Lauren Stefaniak of Coastal Carolina University, and Susanna Lopez-Legentil of University of North Carolina, Wilmington, on a survey of ascidians in Florida in 2017. In 2020, the Florida project was nearing its conclusion and I wanted to continue to work with these talented women, so I suggested that we seek a grant from the National Science Foundation. We wanted to document ascidian biodiversity in an understudied region, and settled on the Caribbean. Prof. Lopez-Legentil and I had both been to a field station in Belize that we knew would be a perfect base of operations. What sparked your own interest in marine biology? I grew up in San Diego, and my dad used to take my sister and me to the tidepools from the time we were very young. I settled on marine biology as a career when I was 10 or 11, and I can’t remember ever wanting to do anything else. My mom worked as a teacher, and my dad trained as a biologist, so I think I was destined to become a biology teacher. Will any Soka students be working with you on this project? Yes. Summer funding will be provided for two students in each of the three summers the grant covers. The grant also includes funding for a workshop in which SUA students and students from other local universities can learn how to identify ascidians. Are you seeing more students interested in marine biology as more become aware of climate change and its impact on our oceans? I am. I teach a course called Nature and Humanity, and I focus this course on the impacts of climate change on humans. I also teach Marine Biology, where we study the impacts of climate change on coral reefs in particular. The students who take these classes are very concerned about climate change and eager to focus on solutions. What about teaching at Soka do you personally find most gratifying? SUA students are a delight to teach. They are curious about the world, self-motivated, kind, and mature. They teach me new things about the world every semester.", "categories": ["Research", "Undergraduate Academics", "Life Sciences", "Faculty News", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "September 01, 2021", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

This is the third round of the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF) and the first time the Department of Education has allowed distribution of federal funds to international, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA), and undocumented students. Eligible SUA students were awarded HEERF III funds last week. In previous HEERF rounds, SUA supported international, DACA, and undocumented students with university funds. Since the beginning of the pandemic, Soka has awarded students in need of financial assistance more than $1.3 million in HEERF and internal funding. Ruthie Kihuguru ’24, a second-year student from Uganda, said the help comes at an opportune time. “In the wake of the social and economic consequences of COVID-19 across the globe, this pleasant surprise lifted a considerable amount of weight from me,” Kihuguru said. “As someone who is neurodivergent and suffers from frequent migraines and headaches, this offer allows me to take better care of myself without worrying about running low on personal funds. I am now better equipped to focus on my health, which will translate positively into how well I perform in my studies, at work, and around friends and faculty members.” Kihuguru said the funds should also help immunocompromised and disabled students protect themselves from the effects of the pandemic. “Even though social solidarity through wearing masks, maintaining social distancing, and acts of service that benefit immunocompromised and disabled folks are at the core of genuine care,” she said, “this relief fund is a definite sustenance.

Although his interests were originally in biochemistry, he thought computer science would allow for exploration of this field at a deeper level. Nitta applied and was accepted into North Dakota State University’s Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program. While there, Nitta used Python, a computer programming language, to create several machine learning models that analyze gene data to identify specific cancer types. To compare the models, he evaluated them based on both accuracy and efficiency. Nitta said most of his work was done independently as he troubleshot problems. “The supervisor only checked and told me errors among codes I typed, so I had to think about how I could fix them,” he said. “I was under pressure but could be more responsible for my assignments than I have ever been.” A few states away, Reika Nyunoya ’23 had an opportunity to combine her interests in medicine, psychology, and scientific research this summer at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science in Rochester, MN.

She learned not to be disappointed in herself when she made an error. “It’s OK to make a mistake as long as you remember and utilize it next time,” she said. Both students were excited to meet new people in person after a year of online learning. “It was such an amazing experience to meet people from around the US and the world with similar interests and share research topics,” Nitta said. While working on their projects, the students became increasingly excited to pursue careers in science. They also created and presented posters to summarize their research findings and look forward to doing more next summer. —Nana Takahashi ’22", "categories": ["Life Sciences"], "date_publish": "September 24, 2021", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

The award, inaugurated last May in honor of the 20th anniversary of SUA’s Aliso Viejo campus, is presented to an individual who has made a major contribution to the global community and inspired positive change in one of the following areas: The annual award includes $25,000 to carry on the winner’s work. The nomination process will open November 18. The deadline for nominations is January 31, 2022, and the recipient will be announced on March 16. The first Soka Global Citizen Award was presented on May 3, 2021, SUA’s anniversary dedication day, to Ambassador Anwarul K. Chowdhury for his dedicated work toward peace, women’s rights, and equality, and for the cause of the world’s poorest and most disadvantaged nations. “We are honored to shine a spotlight on individuals who are using their wisdom, courage, and compassion to lift up others and improve our world,” said Soka University President Ed Feasel. “Our mission is to foster a steady stream of global citizens committed to living a contributive life, people who will give back to their communities and make this world a better place. We encourage nominations of people who are outstanding, inspirational examples of the positive impact of individual effort.” Nomination submittals should include the following: Nominations can be electronically submitted to SokaGlobalCitizen@soka.edu or by mail to Soka Global Citizen Award Committee, Soka University of America, 1 University Drive, Aliso Viejo, CA 92656. Questions regarding the nominating process may be directed to SokaGlobalCitizen@soka.edu . In his 1996 address at Teachers College, Columbia University, Soka University of America Founder Daisaku Ikeda shared: “Global society today faces myriad interlocking crises. These include the issues of war, environmental degradation, the North-South development gap, and divisions among people based on differences of ethnicity, religion, or language. The list is long and familiar, and the road to solutions may seem all too distant and daunting. It is my view, however, that the root of all these problems is our collective failure to make the human being – human happiness – the consistent focus and goal in all fields of endeavor. The human being is the point to which we must return and from which we must depart anew. What is required is a human transformation – a human revolution.” In this address, Mr. Ikeda further shared the essential elements of global citizenship:", "categories": ["Campus News"], "date_publish": "November 17, 2021", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

For nine weeks, Erica Koyama ’23, worked with Susan Walsh, associate professor of molecular/cell biology and director of the Life Sciences concentration, on a project that integrated bioinformatics, cell biology, and biochemistry to determine the function of a yeast protein. Koyama was interested in applying the content she learned in textbooks to a specific research question. What surprised her during her internship was how frequently she had to troubleshoot problems to move forward in her experiments. Doing research, she learned, requires perseverance to answer a scientific question. “Obstacles are an inherent aspect of research, and while things can get frustrating very quickly, it is important to stay patient with yourself and with your research,” she said. She advises other students to enter the lab with an inquisitive mind and ask a lot of questions. Koyama presented her project at the SoCal Undergraduate Chemistry Research Symposium on August 6. Aarohee Bhattarai ’23 worked with SUA biology professors Marie Nydam and Lisa Crummett on a project identifying marine invertebrates. Since she was a child, Bhattarai has been interested in science and wants to join a lab after graduation. Nepal, her home country, has limited science internships so she felt fortunate to have the opportunity to work in a laboratory at SUA for 13 weeks this summer. Her research centered on identifying invertebrates by extracting DNA, performing PCR, and using barcode sequencing to determine the diversity of coral reefs. She also conducted biochemical assays on sea anemones to examine the relationship between light and symbiont density. Working on multiple projects, she learned the necessity of standardizing her experiments to maintain accuracy. Although she analyzed many different species, the techniques were similar and as she intends to study neuroscience, mastering them has helped prepare her. “I had wonderful peers and professors I could talk with and explore new protocols even when things did not work out,” she said. Riley Grosso ’22, Claire Nichols ’21, and Micaela Lafrenz ’23 also worked on research projects this summer in Curie Hall. Next summer, Soka looks forward to welcoming even more student researchers into the laboratories through the generous funding of the Nieves Family Foundation, the Stauffer Family Trust, and the National Science Foundation . — Nana Takahashi ’22", "categories": ["Life Sciences"], "date_publish": "September 24, 2021", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

The May 28 event honored the university’s 17th undergraduate class and the sixth class of the master’s program in Educational Leadership and Societal Change. In a recorded video message, the Reverend James M. Lawson Jr. spoke with the eloquence that once inspired Martin Luther King Jr. to describe him as the leading theorist and strategist of nonviolence in the world. “I am deeply impressed by the fact that Soka University seeks to help each of the students who comes here to become a global citizen, a human being who exploits human creativity and who then shapes their work around how they can help the creative human being to emerge through their work and play through their families and the various vocations that they adopt,” Rev. Lawson said. Inside each student is a singular “life force” or “soul force” that calls them to discovery and implementation. “Exploit it, because in exploiting it, you tap the most creative force of the universe,” Rev. Lawson said, referring to a core teaching of Gandhi. In harnessing the power of their imagination, each graduate “contributes not only to the inward and outward journey of your own being at levels of imagination you’d never understood” but also lives in a manner that will “enable the human race to retrieve its most noble visions of life.” Humans wrongly exploit power to dominate others through violence, which Rev. Lawson called “perhaps the greatest enemy to human rights today.” Instead, he urged the audience to tap “the power of love to see your own life transformed and see the lives of other people transformed.” “That is your homework, the rest of your days, cultivating the heart, the soul, the mind, the capacity of life,” Rev. Lawson said. “Living out the meaning of what it is to see your neighbor as you see yourself. This piece of homework, you must do every day until eternity.” President Edward M. Feasel expressed deep appreciation for everyone who supported the graduates’ journey, and scholarship donors including the Makiguchi Foundation and Lei Loi Tak Memorial Scholarship Program. Addressing the graduates directly, Pres. Feasel noted they were leaving SUA at a time of great uncertainty in the world. “I am confident, however, at SUA, you have developed the robust skills to tackle any challenge and to create harmony with any challenger that tries to derail you,” he said. “Your persistent humanistic efforts at dialogue will continue to be key toward achieving this end.” “As long as you are not defeated at any single moment and strive toward your vision, I firmly believe you will ultimately be victors in life. Please always advance with the spirit of Soka, or value creation, striving to expand your own capabilities while working for the benefit of others in your local, national, and global community.” Pres. Feasel noted that the university’s 20th anniversary coincided with a global pandemic and movement for social justice, which sparked a recommitment to its founding principles, particularly to deepen the culture and ethic of global citizenship in our community. “An important part of that effort has been issues raised by our students of color,” he said, “some who are graduating today who have made every effort to point out areas where SUA needs to improve and build upon. I thank the students of the Black Student Union and the Students of Color Coalition in particular for all of your work and efforts during your time at SUA.” Along with the diplomas mailed to graduates before the ceremony, they received branded gifts from Soka University of America founder Daisaku Ikeda: a photo frame, a commemorative card, an art postcard set, and a book he co-authored with Anwarul K. Chowdhury, “Creating the Culture of Peace: A Clarion Call for Individual and Collective Transformation.” As “Pomp and Circumstance” played, the ceremony picked up energy as each graduate was celebrated by name. Students had submitted quotes before the ceremony, and some alluded to a rollercoaster yet hopeful senior year. “It was the best of times,” wrote Arnold Too, channeling Charles Dickens, “it was the worst of times.” “Relationships are like a rope,” wrote Karolis Batuchtinas. “If you cut it and tie it back together, it brings both ends of the rope closer to each other.” The students’ life force shone in brief video messages. Many recorded themselves in cap and gown. Rodas Dubie Bekele was among those who walked as if on a commencement stage and not many miles from campus. Others, like Kelsey Castanho, moved their tassels; Tanner Montagriff-Peck tossed his mortarboard in the air. “We made it. Peace out!” said Iuna De Sousa. Warren Shinichi Feasel’s photo included his dog. Some students showed off their diplomas and thanked their family, friends, classmates, SUA mentors, faculty, and staff. “My stronghold” is what Kristen Michala Storms called her support circle. Others specifically thanked SUA groups such as the LGBT team and swim team for support. The Zoom chat quickly got busy sending off the graduates with warm felicitations in many languages. The wisdom, courage, and compassion treasured by the SUA community do not exist in isolation, but during a pandemic year students had to find creative ways to achieve Soka’s educational goals of learning the importance of service to others, to the natural world, and to the great cause of peace and freedom. Praise for that resilience also came from their peers who performed and spoke at commencement. “This past year has been really tough considering it’s your last year, and it was all online, but we’re sending you these messages to show our immense gratitude and appreciation for all of your hard work,” said Saanika Joshi ’23. A large ensemble of returning students then performed “On the Path of Peace” and offered personal messages. Student speaker Patricia Yukari Hirano congratulated her classmates who earned master’s degrees in Educational Leadership and Societal Change. “Everything that we were expecting from the program, like the joys of conducting summer research in different countries, or experiencing the graduate life opportunities on campus, we had to put it aside and adjust to the new normal,” she said. “Being fearless while studying in this MA program amidst the challenging time meant feeling the fear and doing it anyway,” she added, ticking off what habits they had to master when in-person classes were suspended. “Being fluid, and embracing change, reflecting and questioning, courageously showing up, and taking action. Staying true to ourselves, never being defeated and creating value out of every situation we were in. And with this spirit, I strongly believe that we will continue to be fearless agents for social change wherever we are.” Muskan Agrawal and Abigail Meyer spoke on behalf of the bachelor of liberal arts graduates. “The last few years were like a rickshaw riding over speed bumps in Delhi, when your entire body is jolted out because the bumps are gigantic,” Agrawal said, mentioning the wildfires that also disrupted residential life. “My four years at Soka have taught me that we are all stronger than we know.” Meyer noted that the Class of 2021 was known for close bonds and shenanigans. “Witnessing some of you trying to choreograph Soka Fest alone is a source of inspiration, considering that our class has proven to be a little less than dance oriented—and I’m looking at myself especially when I say that,” she said. “The community at Soka has not only brought me out of my shell, but it has the courage to say when something isn’t right, when I’m not right, and to encourage one another, during some of the most challenging times of our lives. It has shown me what the true meaning of support is.” Dean of Students Hyon J. Moon read the founder’s Commencement Message to the Class of 2021 in which he conveyed: ”…all of you who are jewels of prodigal light, my warmest congratulations on this day! You have prevailed over challenge after challenge to celebrate your graduation with songs of triumph.” The 2021 commencement made clear SUA is achieving its mission of fostering a steady stream of global citizens committed to living a contributive life. As Masahiro Yokoyama said in his video message thanking everyone who supported his five years (including a bridge year) of undergraduate education at SUA: “I will contribute to the world as a global citizen.” —Michelle Hiskey", "categories": ["Commencement", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "June 02, 2021", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Bridges to Business helped prepare SUA students for those moments through its networking and dining etiquette event on Nov. 6. Close to thirty students and alumni gathered for a simulated business dinner at the Athenaeum. Gina Snyder ,  a career counselor and business etiquette trainer, guided students through the meal, teaching them skills and providing advice. From the Continental way of using a fork and knife to shaking hands gracefully while holding a plate and a glass, Snyder had it all covered during the four-hour event. One key aspect of the event was learning how to make small talk in professional settings, an important stepping stone in forming business connections. Snyder explained that small talk is more significant than it seems. “Small talk leads to big talk,” she said. “And big talk leads to warm connections. Warm connections are people you can call on for advice, ideas, and suggestions, and they can call on you for the same. This can happen quickly at a networking event, or just anywhere you open yourself up to talking with someone you do not know.” The participants had many opportunities to practice as they navigated the group and introduced themselves to other students. There were demonstrations showing the proper way of introducing oneself and others in a group of employees and supervisors, and the students had a wonderful time watching fellow students act out the roles of recruiters and directors of companies. “Coming from Nepal, I had no experience sitting at formal tables and I struggled a lot at the big events I attended here,” said Aashish Sunar ’24. “But after today, I feel much more confident about joining formal dinners and forming connections with people.” The networking and dining event is one of a series that the Bridges to Business program organizes for participants every year to help them develop the skills required to navigate the business world confidently. The Business Plan Competition and the Spring Break Business Bootcamp are some of the events that will be held in the coming months. Mary Patrick Kavanaugh, the Bridges to Business program director, hopes to organize more social gathering events where students can have fun practicing their networking skills. The networking events give guidelines, said Kavanaugh, “to help students feel more comfortable at big events, and I love that we can teach that, and I love that we can teach it in an experiential way.” —Nugnandini Chhetri ’25", "categories": ["Bridges to Business", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "December 07, 2021", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Inspired by a friend who went abroad for her college education, Hidana is now a first-year student at SUA. “It took me 18 years to come to the conclusion that I don’t want to contribute in any way to the culture of war and violence in my country,” Hidana said. “It took me exactly five days at SUA to understand that being passive in the face of conflict is not enough.” Hidana was among the SUA students and alumni who shared their personal experiences living according to the principles of peace during “Living the Culture of Peace in 2021,” Soka’s 8th annual dialogue on peace and non-violence. The Oct. 11 gathering commemorated the 1999 United Nations Declaration and Programme of Action on the Culture of Peace and Non-violence. This year’s dialogue, the first to include student representatives, was held virtually to allow alumni speakers from around the world to participate. In his opening remarks, Anwarul Chowdhury, former under-secretary-general and United Nations Ambassador, honored Soka founder Daisaku Ikeda’s endeavor to build a culture of peace through dialogue. Ambassador Chowdhury emphasized four concepts that are essential to creating a culture of peace: non-violence, the oneness of humanity, global citizenship, and disarmament measures. Moderator Tetsushi Ogata, visiting assistant professor of Peace and Conflict Studies at SUA, noted that Chowdhury’s own efforts were important for the establishment of the UN’s resolutions in support of a culture of peace. Current and former SUA students then shared their experiences and efforts in advocating and implementing a culture of peace in their daily lives. As a descendant of the survivors of the battle of Okinawa during World War II, Hinako Irei ’20, a master’s degree candidate at Claremont Graduate University, recounted a powerful encounter she had with the only living survivor of the attack on Pearl Harbor. That meeting, Irei said, reinforced her commitment to peace and non-violence and taught her that “whether your country politically won or lost ultimately does not matter on an individual level, because you still lose your family, friends, and many loved ones; the atrocity of war allows no true victory.” Two speakers who work in the public health sector emphasized the importance of dialogue in bringing a human connection to a complex and bureaucratic field. Nandini Choudhury ’12, data analyst at the Arnhold Institute for Global Health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, said she’s discovered that “the culture of peace I am learning is not so much about what I do in my career, but how I live my life and show up for those around me.” Jonathan Junqua ’16 recalled his experience as a peacekeeper when he had to work in a group during his time at medical school. The fourth-year candidate for a joint medical and public health degree at Touro University California said he has witnessed the importance of a physician’s acknowledgment and understanding of a person’s situation through dialogue. “Simply communicating your message without acknowledgement and adjustment for another person’s specific situation,” Junqua said, “is talking at someone rather than talking with them.” Students currently on campus are practicing the theories they are discussing in class. Natsuha Kataoka ’23, president of the Student Movement for the Culture of Peace (SMCP), highlighted the connection between each individual’s actions and global citizenship. “Peace must be the result of the cooperative efforts of the whole world,” Kataoka said, “and in this collective endeavor each participant with the conviction to dedicate their lives to the greater movement for world peace is global citizenship.” Another SMCP leader, Subina Thapaliya ’22, said she and other members of that group have organized activities on campus to learn about the threat of nuclear weapons and nuclear disarmament measures. SUA’s founding principles have encouraged her to continue compassion-driven social action and built her confidence to pursue a career helping alleviate poverty in the global South. The journey to global citizenship, the speakers agreed, is an ongoing practice. Said Hidana: “Becoming a global citizen does not mean giving up on any other citizenship you may have. It means holding on to your past and unique identities, and using them to understand and hold compassion towards others.” —Thuy Le ’22, Isa Queano ’23, and Lilia Benavides Medina ’24", "categories": ["Campus News"], "date_publish": "November 08, 2021", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Within the Life Sciences concentration, three research projects are underway—two independent studies and one internship facilitated by a partnership with Soka University of Japan. The projects focus on uncharacterized genes from the yeast genome project, the design of chimeric proteins, and programming for sugar chain informatics. In total, eight students are working with three professors. “The idea is all the students can get some novel research experience even though we can’t be together,” said Susan Walsh, director of the Life Sciences concentration. Due to the nature of virtual school, students are currently focused on research to help them understand relevant scientific concepts. The ultimate goal for these projects, Walsh said, is for students to claim co-authorship of an academic paper written alongside their professors. “If the students do this work and then craft a good proposal,” Walsh said, “we have a script to follow once we get into the lab.” Anh Nguyen ’23 is a member of the independent study focusing on chimeric proteins. She said while online classes have been difficult in unforeseen ways, the intellectually engaging nature of scientific research has kept her motivated. “Mainly I’m just curious, and as a scientist I want to understand everything,” said Nguyen, who is currently living in Vietnam. What engages her about the chimeric protein project, taught by biochemistry professor Rob Levenson, is the potential for practical application. Each student has chosen a set of proteins to fuse with a particular function in mind, and Nguyen said hers is potentially related to cancer. Although she’s realistic about the potential for a medically viable result, she said the process of the research still drives her. “I barely know anything, but I can start to think about curing disease,” Nguyen said. “I feel like I’m still doing something even when I’m studying.” Ran Fukazawa ’23 has been working with a faculty member from the Soka University of Japan on a bioinformatics project. The internship was originally planned for the summer and cancelled after the pandemic hit. Fukazawa, who lives in Japan, reached out to the faculty member in charge of the project and asked if she could work on the internship remotely during the fall. Because the internship focuses on computer programming as a means to conduct research on sugar chains, the SUJ professor agreed. Fukazawa came to SUA with an interest in computer programming and found something familiar in the structure of DNA. “If we unwrap our DNA, it’s just nucleotide sequences,” Fukazawa said. “It’s just letter coding.” Fukazawa was struck by how the seemingly infinite combinations of only four nucleotides— GTCA—can result in a world of diversity. “That makes the human body and living organisms simple and complicated at the same time,” she said. While her internship was originally scheduled for three months, Fukazawa hopes SUJ will extend that period so she can continue working on the project remotely into the spring. —Casey Chaffin ’21", "categories": ["Undergraduate Academics", "Life Sciences", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "November 02, 2020", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

The ceremony, which will be SUA’s first in-person commencement since 2019, is scheduled for 2 p.m. May 27 in the Soka Performing Arts Center. This will mark Ebadi’s first visit to Soka in more than a decade. She first visited campus in 2010 together with late Nobel Peace Laureate, Betty Williams, for a public lecture and question-and-answer session with students. “We are so pleased to welcome Dr. Ebadi back to SUA to share her words of wisdom with our graduates,” Dean of Students Hyon Moon said. “Her life’s work embodies the essential elements of global citizenship—wisdom, courage, and compassion—and serves as a role model for our future leaders of society.” Ebadi is the first woman to serve as a judge in Iran. Not long after beginning her work as a judge in 1969, she obtained her doctorate in private law from Tehran University in 1971 and went on to hold several positions in Iran’s Justice Department. After the Islamic Revolution in 1979, which transformed nearly every facet of Iranian legal and civil life, Ebadi and her fellow female judges were fired and assigned clerical duties. Ebadi soon found herself clerking in the same court she’d recently presided over. Facing this intolerable new reality, Ebadi retired early and applied to Iran’s Bar Association, only to have her application rejected numerous times over the next decade. Finally, in 1992, she obtained her law license and founded her own practice. Ebadi has since represented journalists in cases related to freedom of expression; proposed a law that was ratified in 2002 that prohibits all forms of violence against children in Iran; led research projects for the UNICEF office in Tehran; co-founded the Association for Support of Children’s Rights and a center for human rights in Iran ; and delivered more than 30 university lectures and seminars on human rights around the world. Ebadi lives in exile in London due to increased persecution targeting Iranian citizens critical of the current regime.

Spillers", "text": "In her 1987 essay, “Mama’s Baby, Papa’s Maybe: An American Grammar Book,” Hortense J. Spillers, distinguished visiting professor of literature at SUA, dismantled prevailing ideas about gender and Black communities. In the decades following that groundbreaking article, Spillers became a preeminent American literary critic and Black feminist scholar whose work explores the African diaspora and Black experience in America. Spillers, who was named the Center for Race, Ethnicity and Human Rights’ first visiting fellow, is teaching a two-semester course at SUA on the idea of Black culture. She was Gertrude Conaway Vanderbilt Professor at Vanderbilt University until she retired last year. Spillers’ essays have been collected in Black, White, and In Color: Essays on American Literature and Culture and Comparative American Identities: Race, Sex, and Nationality in the Modern Text . SUA spoke with Spillers from her home in Nashville during winter break. SUA’s student body is unique in its commitment to global citizenship, and also includes a larger percentage of international students than many colleges. Has your experience teaching here been different than at other universities? In a sense it was different because the people who took the course last semester were not people you would think would take the course. There were no Black students in the class. They were all Japanese or Hispanic students, and all women. It was a marvelous experience because they did not come to the class with any well-formed ideas about Black culture or Black people in general. I found them very open-minded. Were they surprised to discover some of the realities of Black life in America? I think the surprises came in the details. They had a general sense of American life and race relations in the United States. That was mostly because of the Black Lives Matter movement and the George Floyd case, as the timing of that trial overlapped the course. And they were aware of discussions about race that have taken place on campus. But I think the details were often shocking. The systematicity of racism interested them, and certain of its tropes. Most surprising to them was the extent to which a lot of what the thinkers we studied, who were writing between the late 19th and the middle of the 20th century, said still has relevance now. You grew up in the South before the Civil Rights Movement. How did that shape your own ideas about race? I grew up in Memphis, Tennessee, at the time that apartheid in the South was officially ending. I saw my mother’s terror when Emmett Till was murdered, because if he had lived he would be a few years older than myself. My mother was absolutely out of her mind about this 14-year-old boy that had just been killed right down the road—Mississippi and west Tennessee are cheek to jowl. So I grew up in that kind of possibility of carnage, in that terror. And I also saw it officially come to an end. So I have seen pretty substantial change take place in society. Given all of that, I went to the University of Memphis at a time when 30 Black kids were so-called integrating a college of 10,000 white kids. Every day was a challenge. You did not know if you were going to make it home off that campus on a particular day. I’ve seen racism. I think I know what evil is and I think I understand something about ignorance, about racial attitudes, but I have never seen what we are going through now. But I keep thinking that there may be enough of us, as Baldwin put it so powerfully in The Fire Next Time , enough white people and Black people who are conscious, so if we do our work maybe we can save things. The radical left movement in the United States has always been cross-racial. It’s often been led by Black people because we were the ones on the bottom of it. But I’ve always believed that when radical whites and radical blacks put their heads together that things in the United States have always changed. That is still my hope. It gives me hope, every day, that at some point we’re gonna snap to it. Where did your own resilience come from? I grew up in an all-Black neighborhood. And this might sound ironic or a little strange, but I think growing up in an all-Black neighborhood where all the good that you saw in the world and all the bad that you knew about in the world was generated by people like yourself. So you grew up thinking that nobody in the world was smarter than you or better than you. Because you knew kids who were so smart they were going to Fisk University in the 10th grade. You knew people who were so smart that MIT sent recruiters down to Memphis in 1968 to recruit people. There were Bibles and books. And you had three newspapers in your household. One of them was the Pittsburgh Courier that had a beautiful centerfold with pictures of people like Thurgood Marshall. I knew we were poor, but it didn’t matter. By the time I was 19, I had a sense of who I was that nobody could mess with existentially. You could mess with it on the surface but you were just not gonna convince me that I was inferior and something was wrong with me. I just thought that the way the world was treating us was just simply wrong. That’s where that determination came from. It came out of a circumstance and then the adults behind us who were pushing us. We had teachers who loved us. I was 13 years old and expressed the wish to become President of the United States, and some of the older women in my church looked around at each other and said, “You know what, she can probably do it.” So when did you decide to teach instead? At one point I did want to be a politician. I wanted to be a lawyer, and then I wanted to be a broadcast journalist. In college I was a disc jockey at a station in Memphis that was one of the first, if not the first Black radio stations in the US. I was a DJ, but I really wanted to do news commentary. Ironically, I got to do commentary the weekend that John F. Kennedy was killed because I was on the radio and the station suspended playing music. I wrote up my commentary and read it on the air for an hour. I was going to take a test to become a broadcast engineer, but I decided that I just loved William Blake’s prophetic books more. I loved the English Romantic poets. So in 1968, a few months after Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination, I took off from Memphis for the doctoral program in English and American literature at Brandeis University. At the risk of oversimplifying your long and distinguished career, what would you say is the overarching theme of your work or the question you’ve most wanted to investigate? The question that has preoccupied me most would be the extent to which Black personality has responded to modernity. Before modernity, which dates back to the 15th century, I don’t think there was any such thing as Black personality. There was certainly the idea of an African personality. With the start of the transatlantic slave trade and the creation of an African diaspora, something called Black personality that didn’t have to exist before had to exist. There was a need to talk about a personality in relationship to heterogeneous personalities including European peoples, native peoples, and so forth. We saw the creation of this new thing in the world called Black or diasporic personality that is both African but not quite African, and not all African but African plus something else. And what is that something else? That plus factor that has been the big puzzle for me. How has it affected the lives of those populations? What’s been the fate of gender in relationship to ideas about family and kin? All the same questions that confront human beings have confronted human beings in these populations, but given the history out of which those populations were created the answers have not been anticipated. In other words, we have not been able to anticipate answers to those questions based on a standard sense of how human beings behave in the world because there’s nothing standard about this situation. We make stabs at it, but it really isn’t a once-and-for-all. It’s a constant creation, and that’s hard to swallow. We are always creating the circumstances of our lives at the same time the circumstances of our lives are creating us. They’re in a kind of dialogical relationship. I think the situation of a Black personality in the modern world has to be clarified every generation. We keep thinking we’re going to get to a point and stop, that we won’t have to fight those battles anymore. It comes as a rude shock that we’re constantly fighting. Do you feel that diversity efforts in higher education are important and helpful in fighting systemic racism? I think so, but it’s complicated in the sense that if a fetish is made of diversity it becomes a problem. And what does that mean? Well, it’s hard to describe, but I think you kind of know it when you see it. Some universities have created deans of diversity, for example, and put the task in the hands of a particular person. I wonder what that will do because it’s going toward the kind of fetishization that I’m talking about. But how do you get at diversity? It is a big, big subject. Maybe you get diversity by not calling it that all the time. Maybe diversity comes in different guises and disguises. I think what higher education should really be about is not only diversity but literacy. The job of the university is cultural literacy. Cultural literacy encompasses just about everything, but what it mostly means is fomenting and creating critical intelligence so people go out into the world with the power to know the difference between a con man and one who is authentic. We should be about the business of creating critical people rather than gullible people. That’s the hard part. That’s what we’re not doing. There are people who honestly believe that the education failures in society have to do with the undereducation of Black kids and kids of color, but it has to do with all the children in the United States. We are looking at a society that is coming apart at the seams and a lot of that is the failure of critical intelligence. You can put all of it under the rubric of ignorance. If you have a society that is ignorant, you can’t get any messages through—about women, minorities, diversity, critical race theory, or Black Lives Matter. You can’t get any of that through because people are not thinking anymore. They are feeling. They are emoting. They’re having opinions. But they are not thinking critically. I think we’re quite sick in body and mind and spirit in our society and that we need massive help. So how do we keep fighting? I have no solution in my head, except that I think the only thing you can do is rail against it. You can write about it, you can talk about it, you can teach about it. I think of a certain kind of scholarship as activism. I don’t see any disparity between a certain kind of scholarship, a certain kind of writing, and a political commitment. I would say a lot of the works I have taught over nearly 50 years of teaching are transformative and can possibly change people’s lives. Or the way they see things in their lives. I don’t think of scholarship as something that comes out of an ivory tower or something that is detached from living in the world. It participates in its own way of living. And you just keep hammering away. That little bit chips away at it. I think that’s the best we can do.", "categories": ["Faculty News", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "March 21, 2022", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

However, studying there this semester has taught her that the new Life Sciences building is much more than steel, concrete, and glass. “Soka’s interdisciplinary curriculum creates scientists of compassion, not competition,” Koyama said. “This hall is a representation of Dr. Marie and Pierre Curie’s legacy of tenacity and intellectual curiosity.” Koyama was one of two students who addressed the 200 virtual and 50 in-person guests at the Curie Hall Dedication Ceremony on November 18. After launching the Life Sciences concentration in 2020, Curie Hall remained empty during the school year due to SUA’s decision to adopt virtual learning in response to the pandemic. Students’ return to campus for the 2021 Fall semester thus saw Curie Hall utilized by students and faculty for the first time in person. In his opening remarks, SUA President Edward Feasel said, “We have come full circle in the 20th anniversary celebration with today’s dedication event for our new science hall, marking a major milestone in our campus’ growth.” He thanked donors worldwide who made the 90,000-square-foot science hall’s construction possible, as well as SUA alumni who advocated for a Life Sciences concentration to support students interested in pursuing graduate studies or a career in health or science. Pres. Feasel noted that those students, including Isamu Yoshioka ’05, the first SUA alumnus to pursue a career in medicine and who attended the ceremony, didn’t have the options today’s students do. “As a student, Isamu had to take science courses during his summer break, like many of our students before this Life Sciences concentration, at local colleges like UC Irvine, just to prepare for their post-baccalaureate medical program,” Pres. Feasel said. “The contribution and trailblazing efforts of alumni like Isamu led to the establishment of the Life Sciences concentration and this new, incredible science building at SUA.” After Pres. Feasel’s welcome, Soka Student Union president Yuka Hombo ’22 expressed appreciation for the faculty, staff, and donors whose efforts and contributions impact Soka students’ education. Hombo was followed by a series of SUA faculty members and students who shared their excitement and vision for the new facilities and curriculum that will allow students to prepare for careers in health and science. Sergio Prince, representing Orange County Supervisor Lisa Bartlett, presented Pres. Feasel with a Certificate of Recognition for the Dedication of Marie and Pierre Curie Hall and shared a quote from Marie Curie: “Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.” As Koyama’s remarks suggest, the new Life Sciences courses are part of Soka’s expansive liberal arts offerings and informed by its focus on encouraging global citizenship. Life Sciences students are trained to develop a humanistic perspective that doesn’t lose sight of the moral and ethical dimensions of their scientific practice. In her remarks, Susan Walsh, director of the Life Sciences concentration and associate professor of molecular/cell biology, said it is common for people to think first about laboratories, fancy equipment, and glassware when imagining a science building. Walsh believes such concrete objects only tell part of the story, however, as “it is the interaction of the students and faculty within these laboratory and study spaces that truly creates the spirit of a science building.”", "categories": ["Life Sciences", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "December 07, 2021", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

With no one around her willing to explain what the word “menstruation” meant, she was in for a terrifying experience at the age of 13. Only after Adhikari got her first period did she receive an explanation of the menstrual cycle. Nepal’s limited sex education inspired Adhikari and two other students, Paridhi Khanduri ‘25 and Nugnandini Chhetri ‘25, to brainstorm a solution. Their project “Embracing the Red” tied for first place out of the eight projects entered in the fifth annual Impactathon. “Enjovu Paper,” submitted by Anthea Mudanye ’23, Yixin Wang ’23, and Qiankuan Yang ’23, shared first place with a plan to recycle elephant dung for eco-friendly paper. Impactathon, a business venture competition hosted by Soka’s Bridges to Business (B2B) program, invites current SUA students and alumni to solve real social issues using business models. On the weekend of February 2-4, 2022, the groups turned their ideas into business pitches with the guidance of leaders in the social impact sector. Participants learned more about designing business models, applied their knowledge to create innovative proposals, and gained valuable experience working in teams. A panel of judges composed of experts in various industries evaluated each group after they gave short presentations on their projects. The 2021 Impactathon award winners are as follows: The “Embracing the Red” team’s method of raising awareness for menstrual education was the Me-Box, marketed as an educational tool offering an enjoyable and effective way for Nepali students to teach themselves about this physiological process. Highlights of the Me-Box include period products, which include sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups; games such as uterus puzzles and vocabulary flashcards; and informative pamphlets on the menstrual cycle. Designed to be environmentally friendly, the Me-Box would be made out of sustainable products such as cardboard. “With this Me-Box, the students will not only get informed about how to use all sanitary products [and] know the workings of a menstrual cycle by playing games,” said Khanduri, “but they will generally be educated and ready for their period. Or their mother’s period. Or their sister’s period.” Adhikari, Khanduri, and Chhetri displayed an incredible amount of passion for fighting menstrual stigma in Nepal. Considered a taboo subject in the country, they acknowledged it would not be an easy task to distribute the boxes to the schools. However, faced with this reality, they were not discouraged. “As someone who never had any knowledge of business, it is wonderful how B2B lets anyone aboard as long as they are willing to put in the effort,” Chhetri said. “It has provided me with an opportunity to think about how we can practically use all that we learn in our classes—compassion, courage, and solving global issues.” “Embracing the Red” set a goal to work with the existing organizations in Nepal focused on menstrual awareness and accessibility. Adhikari, a social entrepreneur, planned to leverage their positions in the local organizations She the Kranti and Pad2Go. By cooperating with these organizations, the team hoped to identify the target market and educational institutions to sell their Me-Boxes. Their business plan calculates a cost of $36 for one Me-Box. The plan is to target 100 schools in Nepal with three boxes per school, resulting in a start-up cost of $10,800. Funding for their enterprise would come from the previously mentioned local organizations, as well as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). Additionally, private schools who use Me-Boxes would be charged an annual membership fee of $45 to cover a portion of the costs. The panel of judges expressed their admiration for the group’s dedication toward tackling the stigmatized issue. “I love your feminism and I’m super supportive of it, as I think all of us are in this room, and just let us know how we can help you,” said Shaheen Sheik-Sadhal, one of the contest judges and the founding attorney of the corporate firm Esse Law PC. The Me-Box idea will continue to undergo development in preparation for UC Irvine’s New Venture Competition. Khanduri and Chhetri, alongside several other Impactathon participants, will take their business proposal to UC Irvine while Adhikari studies abroad this semester. “Most students come to the B2B Impactathon event with no background in business, but with passion and a sincere desire to tackle social issues and solve problems,” said B2B Director Mary Patrick Kavanaugh. “I’m always energized by how they quickly unearth root causes of social justice issues, determine where they can provide value, and reframe their solutions into marketable business models. The annual Impactathon event is one of multiple skill-building and entrepreneurial pathways that Soka’s B2B program offers students.

Noting the critical role Ambassador Young played in shaping history as one of Martin Luther King, Jr.’s lieutenants in the American civil rights struggle, Soka University of America Vice President Kevin Moncrief said honoring him with the Soka Global Citizen Award “is a unique and rare opportunity for Soka University of America. Ambassador Young is highly aligned with our mission to ‘Foster Global Citizens’ around the world and on our beautiful campus.” In January 2021, Ambassador Young and Distinguished Visiting Professor Hortense Spillers conducted a dialogue to commemorate the life and contributions of Dr. King, the first event co-sponsored by SUA’s newly established Center for Race, Ethnicity, and Human Rights and its Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Beginning his career as a pastor, Ambassador Young became an early leader in the civil rights movement. He served as executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and later became active in politics, serving as the first Black congressman from Georgia since reconstruction; a US ambassador to the United Nations in the Carter administration; the first Black mayor of Atlanta; and the leader of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, bringing in tens of billions of dollars of private investment to Georgia before and since. Ambassador Young, who turned 90 on March 12, has received numerous awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, France’s Légion d’honneur, the NAACP Spingarn Medal, and more than 45 honorary degrees from universities such as Dartmouth, Yale, Notre Dame, Clark Atlanta, and Emory. He continues to lead a vital and contributive life today, currently heading up several large-scale projects, including the Aquaponics Project to provide food security worldwide. Ambassador Young is also leading the Lemna project, which aims to extract rich plant-based organic protein and ethanol from globally available tiny aquatic plants to provide alternative wholesome organic protein and help alleviate malnutrition. He recently established the International University of Grand-Bassam in Cote d’Ivoire, Africa, a scholarship program for students attending Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and is working on various television documentaries and health and healing projects, including fighting HIV-1 and Ebola virus disease. Finally, he is playing an integral role in Mobile Harbor, a project to improve the international commerce capacity of U.S. ports. The Soka Global Citizen Award, inaugurated by SUA President Edward M. Feasel in 2021, includes a $25,000 stipend to help continue Ambassador Young’s honored work. Ambassador Young, who spent several decades handling domestic and international conflicts, is renowned for his ability to use diplomacy and negotiation to bridge the chasm between opposing sides. Speaking to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2018 about non-violent approaches to conflict resolution, Ambassador Young said, “There’s no problem on the planet that can’t be solved without violence. That’s the lesson of the civil rights movement. There were serious problems here. We could have had a bloodbath. We made democracy—which is a substitute for violence—work. And we could not have made democracy work with violence.” Young is the second recipient of the Soka Global Citizen Award. The inaugural winner was Ambassador Anwarul K. Chowdhury , the former Bangladesh ambassador to the United Nations who was honored for his life’s work and achievements for peace, women’s rights and equality, and for the cause of the world’s poorest and most disadvantaged nations.", "categories": ["Campus News"], "date_publish": "March 16, 2022", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Just as the prosecution stated at the beginning of the trial, the world witnessed “a bouquet of humanity” through the testimony of bystanders who tried in multiple ways to save the life of George Floyd. One after another, adults, youth and even children shared their disappointment, disgust and horror at witnessing the treatment of George Floyd on the day he died. On the other hand, in Derek Chauvin we saw the inhumanity of a person who, due to the lack of respect for the dignity and sanctity of George Floyd’s life, took actions that ended Floyd’s life. The trial again demonstrates the clear need for police and institutional reform, especially for Black lives in America and throughout the world, given the extreme record of abuses they have experienced. I hope in our individual ways, we will lend our voices and actions in our own communities to call for such reform. While there is much work to be done to assure such tragic loss of life will not happen again in our communities, we must strive to foster values within our own campus community that can be a model for others. We must continue to promote and further develop an education that upholds and inculcates in our community a respect and value for the sanctity of life, under any circumstances.

While this marks the second year in a row Soka students have placed first or second in the competition’s grand finale, Mary Patrick Kavanaugh, SUA director of special projects and the Bridges to Business program, believes the students’ multifaceted growth is even more impressive than their showing. “Participating in a business plan competition alongside MBA students and entrepreneurs is not unlike studying abroad,” Kavanaugh said. “Students must learn the language, immerse themselves in the culture, and interact with those native to business. These experiences ultimately lead them to be more conscious, empowered global citizens who now know they have the agency to enact change.” Enjovu envisions producing paper from elephant dung. The name “Enjovu” is derived from “Njovu,” which means “elephant” in Luganda, Mudanye’s native language. The team chose elephants for their project because they digest only about 50% of their food, making their waste extremely fibrous—an essential quality of good paper. Beyond the utility of elephants’ waste for paper production, the team also wanted to raise awareness for the endangered species. The elephant population has decreased more than 80% worldwide in the last 25 years, and there are fewer than 300 elephants left in Wang and Yang’s home country of China. The team conceptualized the Enjovu project during Impactathon, a business competition organized by SUA’s Bridges 2 Business program, at the beginning of the 2022 spring semester. After winning first place in the competition, they decided to bring their idea to the UCI event. Aarohee Bhattarai ’23 and two UCI students joined the team after the B2B competition in preparation for their concept submission. The expanded team spent the next two months honing the idea before turning in the concept paper. The competition committee selected their paper, and the team pitched their idea in the semifinals on May 13, fielding questions from a panel of judges from Orange County’s startup ecosystem. The team placed second in their competition track, earning a $5,000 prize and a spot in the finals. On June 3, the top two teams from each track faced off in a three-minute fast-pitch at the finals. Enjovu placed second overall, also winning the “Audience Favorite” vote, to win an additional $5,000. The networking event following the competition was eye-opening for the Enjovu team. Local investors and businesspeople offered guidance about the accelerator programs they should try, while others just wanted to know how they developed such an ingenious project. “Our confidence grew as people approached us to learn more about the project,” Bhattarai said. “The win means that we did great as a team, we had great mentors, and our project is trustworthy and feasible with the proper network.” Participating in the competition allowed the team to flesh out their idea and envision potential steps toward making it a reality. Although the students do not have immediate plans to operationalize Enjovu, the $10,000 they won will enable them to take the next steps when they are ready—and Kavanaugh believes they will have both the resources and mindset needed to succeed when that time comes. “Liberal arts students who initially believed they had no interest in business have shifted from the mindset of ‘they do that’ to the epiphany ‘I do that,’ ” Kavanaugh said. —Nugnandini Chhetri ’25", "categories": ["Bridges to Business", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "August 04, 2022", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

{"newspaper": "soka-news", "url": "https://www.soka.edu/news-events/news/celebrating-life-mitsu-kimura-beloved-founding-staff-member", "title": "Celebrating the Life of Mitsu Kimura, Beloved Founding Staff Member", "text": "Soka University of America held a memorial service for founding SUA staff member Mitsu Kimura this month to celebrate his extraordinary life and contribution to the development of Soka for more than three decades, with over 100 people attending in person and 400 joining virtually around the world. “Mitsu positively impacted every life he came into touch with,” said President Edward Feasel. “His thoughts were always directed at others, how to support them and make them happy and at peace.” Those who spoke after President Feasel remembered Kimura’s iconic smile, energy, positivity, humor, and loving nature. He led a long, varied career serving students and developing the foundation of SUA dating back to the opening of the graduate school in Calabasas in 1987. He began as assistant secretary and assistant financial officer and was appointed assistant administrative officer in 1990. In 1992, he became the assistant vice president for administration and dean of students. In 2004, three years after the Aliso Viejo campus opened, Kimura was appointed director of international development, and in 2007, he became university archivist and photographer and senior adviser to development. While Kimura’s skill and passion for photography were evident, his abilities sprang from a deeper, less visible well of purpose. As a member of the third graduating class of Soka University of Japan, university founder Daisaku Ikeda impressed upon him and other students the importance of recording and preserving history. Kimura never lost this sense of purpose when documenting SUA (and SULA) events. As he documented the university’s history, Kimura was always envisioning the future. He once shared with his student workers that he was determined to take photos that would move the hearts of people who see them 100 years from now. One such former student, Aiki Matsukura ’13, spoke on behalf of the many alumni who cherished their relationship with Kimura. She said that while Kimura often gave students serious advice and encouragement, he would also never forget to make them laugh. For students who hadn’t been able to eat much, he would secretly warm his delicious handmade red bean buns. Underlying each of Kimura’s commitments, Matsukura said, was his extraordinary love for and dedication to SUA students. Matsukura recalled how Kimura once shared with her that remembering names is one of the most important things you can do to make other people feel comfortable and get the best smile from them during a photo shoot. As she observed Kimura call people’s names during commemorative photo sessions if their face was not visible, Matsukura initially thought Kimura could just naturally remember everyone’s name. One day, she saw Kimura’s student directory lying on his desk. It was covered in handwritten notes about each student. “Then I realized how much effort he was putting into this, and how much he cares about each and every student,” Matsukura said. Executive Vice President of University Community Katherine King, who worked with Kimura since their time together at SUA, Calabasas, recalled how Kimura even took time to take photos at her father’s memorial to preserve her family’s memories. When his own mother’s health began to fail, Kimura was there to take care of her. “I would often see him and his mother,” King said. “It touched my heart how deeply he cared for her.” The importance of family was central to Kimura’s dedication to others. “His daughter Stephanie was the light of his life,” King said. “He was so proud of her and all her accomplishments, even after he got sick. Every time I spoke with him, the first thing he shared was how Stephanie was doing.” Kimura’s daughter, Stephanie Mitsuko Kukita ’08, shared a touching tribute during the memorial service via Zoom from Japan. Although she was worried about her father during his battle with cancer, she said he was so optimistic and joyful that she couldn’t believe he was ill. He would often tell her that this was the most joyful time in his life and that there was so much more he wanted to do. Addressing her father directly near the end of her words, Kukita said, “I will definitely miss you, but please know that you will live through our memory. I will take on your spirit and make sure to do all the things you wanted to do and continue protecting SUA, which you helped create.”", "categories": ["Campus News"], "date_publish": "November 15, 2022", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},
{"newspaper": "soka-news", "url": "https://www.soka.edu/news-events/news/announcing-opening-soka-heritage-hall-campus", "title": "Announcing the Opening of Soka Heritage Hall on Campus", "text": "Soka Heritage Hall, which chronicles SUA’s history and the heritage and founders of Soka education, Tsunesaburo Makiguchi, Josei Toda, and Daisaku Ikeda, opened on campus this October. “Visitors to the hall will embark on a journey of SUA’s heritage and the vision of the founders of Soka education, Tsunesaburo Makiguchi, Josei Toda, and Daisaku Ikeda,” President Edward Feasel said. “It is my hope that everyone who visits Soka Heritage Hall will develop a deeper understanding of SUA’s founding spirit and mission.” Aashish Sunar ’24: When I walked around Soka Heritage Hall, looking at the history of SUA and pictures of our alumni, many of whom are supporting me in my intellectual and personal growth, my heart was overwhelmed with emotions. I could feel the sincere efforts of our founder, alumni, and donors to make SUA a citadel of hope. How can I fail when so many people have entrusted their hope to me? I will win. I will win for them. I believe that Soka education is essential now more than ever before to fight against global challenges, such as poverty, discrimination, and war. Visiting Soka Heritage Hall inspired me to become the voice of thousands of underprivileged people who may not have voices themselves. Ayu Nakazaki ’25: After viewing Soka Heritage Hall, I thought how remarkable it is to be a student at such a young institution—one where its rich history is not a thing of the distant past and where the students still receive encouraging messages from the founder! Deepening my understanding of Soka’s heritage cultivates my own unshakable purpose to pursue a university education, and deepens my awareness of my incredible responsibility as an SUA student to uphold our university’s mission. Based on our deepened understanding of the heritage of Soka education, I hope my fellow SUA students and I can make the most of our time at college by challenging ourselves to expand our intellectual, social, emotional, and spiritual capacities. Emi Kuroda ’23: Visiting Soka Heritage Hall encouraged me to not give up on my challenges and growth. I was inspired by the following quote from the founder displayed in the hall: “Dialogue is the painstaking and persistent effort to remove all obstacles that obscure our common humanity.” I learned that I’m capable of truly respecting and understanding others (and so is everyone!), and therefore I should never give up on having sincere dialogues with others. The development of the hall, near the Athenaeum on the southwestern edge of campus, is part of the 20th anniversary project, “Soka Global Citizens: Embodying Wisdom, Courage, and Compassion.” The hall was completed thanks to the hard work of SUA’s staff, alumni, and precious donors. A small stone monument near the entrance to the hall is engraved with Ikeda’s calligraphy for “wisdom,” “courage,” and “compassion,” the core principles of global citizenship outlined in his seminal 1996 Columbia University address. In the foyer, SUA’s principles, mottos, and mission statement are featured prominently alongside photos of programs and initiatives that exemplify how the university has put them into practice. Exhibit rooms branch off the central hallway, highlighting Ikeda’s multifaceted efforts as an author, educator, and citizen diplomat to promote peace, education, and intercultural dialogue and exchange alongside SUA students’ and alumni’s global efforts to actualize the ideals and mission. The Dialogue Room features a large world map that illustrates SUA students’ countries of origin and locations where they have studied abroad or traveled to during Learning Clusters. Although Ikeda has never visited SUA’s campus in Aliso Viejo, California, Soka students have enjoyed warm and meaningful exchanges with the school’s founder since 2001. The Exchanges with the Founder Room highlights these personal exchanges, including the background of the beloved “Founder’s Snacks”; a showcase of sheet music for SUA’s two school songs; small gifts of encouragement; poems and messages to the students and university; and the manuscript of Ikeda’s dedication message when SUA opened in 2001. There are also several rooms dedicated to the founding and origins of Soka education, detailing Tsunesaburo Makiguchi’s (1871–1944) and Josei Toda’s (1900–1958) courageous commitment to peace, human rights, and value-creating education. Makiguchi, a geographer, author, and educator, was an outspoken critic of the indoctrination of children under imperial Japan’s education system. He promoted value-creating education, a philosophy he developed over many years of teaching, enriched by his practice of Nichiren Buddhism. Together with Toda, his closest disciple, they founded the Soka Kyoiku Gakkai (Value-Creating Education Society), the educators society that has since expanded into one of the world’s largest lay Buddhist organizations, the Soka Gakkai. A display case features a copy of Toda’s A Deductive Guide to Arithmetic , which sold over a millions copies. Toda used the profits from the guide to fund the publication of Makiguchi’s foundational work The System of Value-Creating Pedagogy on Nov. 18, 1930, the publication of which also dates the foundation of the Soka Kyoiku Gakkai.

One of those former students, Prakash Bista ’17, described developing schools in Nepal with a mission that echoes SUA’s: providing what students need to reach their full potential to live a contributive life regardless of their life circumstances. The purpose of the gathering was clear, and the 293 guests attending “Celebrating a Vision of Peace,” on campus and online on Oct. 8, rose to the occasion. The 18th annual event raised almost $1.2 million—a SUA record—to ensure that future peacemakers may benefit from a SUA education regardless of their financial or economic status. Reacting to the alumni messages, Master of Ceremonies Gene Kang, Emmy award-winning journalist with KTLA 5 News in Los Angeles, said that knowing young people are doing this work “despite so much going on in the world, with wisdom, courage, and compassion, is truly something that actually educates and brings up the level of humanity all around the world.” SUA President Edward Feasel put its peace-making mission in context when he took the stage. In his conversations with SUA’s newest undergraduate and graduate students—50 percent of whom are international students—Pres. Feasel noted that most said they chose SUA both because of its mission to educate global citizens and because of its generous financial aid. He thanked the many donors who make their bright futures possible. When opening the Soka Institute for Global Solutions this past May, a response to SUA founder Daisaku Ikeda’s 1987 call for the establishment of such an institute, Pres. Feasel saw that peace education was fundamental to finding solutions to the human rights, environmental, and development crises that plague our planet. He determined that SIGS’ two inaugural projects would focus on creating resources for global citizenship education at the K-12 level and addressing the crisis of nuclear weapons. The full SUA experience, including academic concentrations and study abroad, allows all students to explore peaceful solutions to complex global issues. “I firmly believe our students and our alumni are the hope for humanity, and everyone here at SUA, whether student, faculty, or staff, realizes that it is because of our donors that we have the resources to educate global citizens,” Pres. Feasel said. After a lively and successful auction, and a rousing performance by Freda Payne, the singer and actress best known for her hit “Band of Gold,” the evening closed with additional messages of gratitude from several SUA alumni making a difference in the world. Emmanuel Gebremeskel ’19, originally from Ethiopia, described how his multidisciplinary education has prepared him to pursue his dream of becoming a concierge of business in Africa. Without the support of donors, “a little boy like me from Ethiopia would not have been able to experience the world through the portal that you’ve created…I would not have been able to meet the people I’ve met, I would not have been able to learn the things I’ve learned, and I would not potentially be able to make the impact at the scale that I want to make.” Julia Odano ’08 reflected on how the values inherent in an SUA education have helped her develop as a leader and manager in her sales career. She expressed gratitude to SUA donors whose support is evidence of global citizenship “because it’s their wisdom, it’s their compassion, and their care for others that allowed me to have a phenomenal education.”", "categories": ["Campus News"], "date_publish": "October 19, 2022", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

During an opportunity to engage in dialogue with diplomats from around the world at the United Nations, one said something that resonates with her today. The diplomat compared the power of youth to the North Wind in Aesop’s fable, “The North Wind and the Sun.” It is powerful and novel, and has significant potential as a catalyst for peace. “For me, peace does not mean people are in an idealistic, euphoric state,” Nishikawa said. “Rather, peace is about one’s persistent attitude and efforts to challenge obstacles, always aiming toward a culture of peace even if the process may seem like a whirlwind.” Nishikawa was among the SUA students and alumni who demonstrated the truth of these words by sharing how they are creating a culture of peace in their everyday lives during “Living and Translating the Culture of Peace at the Local Level,” Soka’s ninth annual dialogue on peace and non-violence. The hybrid event allowed speakers and audience members to participate in person and online from around the world. In his opening remarks, Anwarul Chowdhury, former under-secretary-general and United Nations ambassador, discussed the essential elements for understanding the difference between “peace” and a “culture of peace.” “When we say peace, we have a tendency to feel it will be done by diplomats … It is somebody else’s job,” Chowdhury said. “But when we say, ‘‘culture of peace,’ it is my job. The culture of peace starts with myself.” Dr. Jacqueline Mills ‘08, visiting assistant professor of general education, global health, and health professions advisor, described an early step in her journey. As a student, she participated in SUA’s first United Nations Study Tour, where she met Ambassador Chowdhury and learned about the culture of peace for the first time. Dr. Mills had studied the history of genocides in the 20th century the previous year and was feeling disheartened. During the visit to New York, Dr. Mills also met Benjamin Ferencz, former chief prosecutor of the Nuremberg trials, who was 87 years old at the time. She asked Ferencz how he maintains hope and continues fighting for peace after everything he experienced. Every day that he works to create peace, Ferencz replied, there is that much less evil in the world. His comment inspired her to continue working for peace in her own way. She subsequently became a physician, has cared for thousands of individuals, and continues to work on addressing inequities in clinical medicine and global health. Tom Gregg, senior advisor on humanitarian affairs to the United Nations under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and senior advisor to the World Health Organization, then shared his wisdom from nearly two decades engaging non-state armed groups and local communities on behalf of governments, the United Nations, and NGOs. When an SUA student asked what skills he should develop to become an effective leader, Gregg recalled his first boss saying he wanted him to do three things as he began his new job: listen, listen, and listen. “I think that is something we can all do at every stage of our lives,” Gregg said. “To be a leader, you have to be a good listener.”", "categories": ["Campus News"], "date_publish": "October 19, 2022", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

The program continued with a conversation about Black identity, vitality, and voices at SUA. About 70 members of the Soka community met in the Student Affairs lobby and on Zoom for “Black Identity and Vitality: Centering Joy and Well Being.” Sponsored by the Black Student Union (BSU) and the Office of Student Activities, this year’s panel explored the complexities of Black identity while centering joy and well being, and the contributions of the African diasporas in developing and maintaining vitality. The panel featured students, faculty, and staff, including Hamza Ibrahim ’23 and Gaelle Pierre-Louis ’24; Nidanie Henderson-Stull, assistant professor of biochemistry; and Jonathan Wray, director of career services. The discussion was moderated by Yinka Aduloju ’24. Following the recognition of student leaders of the BSU, the African Student Association, and Soka’s Black-identifying students, panelists responded to questions about identity, the driving force to persist, the significance of community, racial battle fatigue, and actualizing freedom and self-determination. “Since this impactful gathering, I often recall the precious memories shared by the panelists of their hardworking families as well as the exhausting challenges they continue to face,” said Hiroko Tomono, director of the Ikeda Library at SUA. In addition to the discussion, an interactive Black art exhibit mounted in the Student Affairs lobby featured photographs, artwork, and videos that welcomed participants’ engagement.

{"newspaper": "soka-news", "url": "https://www.soka.edu/news-events/news/academic-leaders-gather-sua-explore-liberal-arts-education-pacific-rim", "title": "Academic Leaders Gather at SUA to Explore Liberal Arts Education in the Pacific Rim", "text": "Speaking to academic leaders gathered at SUA in June, John Sexton, president emeritus of NYU, made clear the importance of their efforts to support liberal arts education. In a divisive world facing acute challenges—climate change and economic inequality to name only two—Sexton said, “universities are the last best hope.” Twenty educational leaders representing six of the nine members of the Pacific Alliance of Liberal Arts Colleges (PALAC) met in the Athenaeum June 3-4 to begin sharing ideas and plans to encourage liberal arts education in the Pacific Rim. Joining Soka’s team of Bryan Penprase, vice president for external academic relations; Arch Asawa, executive vice president for finance and administration; and Kevin Moncrief, vice president for mission integration, were representatives from Pomona College, University of Puget Sound, Quest University Canada, Fulbright University Vietnam, and Duke Kunshan University. Teams from NYU Shanghai, Hong Kong Baptist University, and Beijing Normal University-Hong Kong Baptist University United International College tuned in online. Running through the participants’ discussions over the two-day event was the awareness of the state of the countries around the world and the health of the planet itself, and the role of liberal arts education and the PALAC alliance in helping to address these complex, interlocking issues. As Sexton, who was president of NYU when it opened its Abu Dhabi campus, noted in his keynote address, “A Twenty-First Century Case for a Liberal Arts Education,” evocative storytelling is needed to make the case for the possibilities of liberal arts education in cultures with less exposure to its benefits. But for liberal arts education to fulfill its potential, it must be available not just to elites, but to immigrants, refugees, and all students. In her talk following Sexton’s, G. Gabrielle Starr, president of Pomona College, asserted the need to reimagine the curriculum to adjust to a changing world. “We are still using a model of higher education from the 19th century,” she said. Starr highlighted two important lessons from the pandemic for educators to keep in mind as they imagine the possibilities: the remarkable collaboration among nations and the scientific community that resulted in the rapid development and large-scale distribution of vaccines, and the success of putting more students pursuing careers in areas such as health care into real-world settings earlier than in the past. “There is something incredibly powerful in collaborative education and just doing it,” said Starr, who urged alliance members to look for ways to put “students in the middle of as many places and circumstances as possible.” Teams from each of the institutions described current initiatives that might offer opportunities for PALAC collaborations. Michael Weiner, executive vice president of academic affairs, described SUA’s learning clusters, study abroad, and offerings from the Center for Race, Ethnicity, and Human Rights. Those programs could support PALAC’s goals if SUA students, for example, visited other PALAC campuses for a learning cluster project. Language instruction might also benefit from online interactions with their students and faculty. “We need to develop new and necessary pathways if we are to produce generations of global citizens,” Weiner said. Pomona’s Starr outlined the college’s new internationalization efforts that promise to help foster greater interdisciplinarity and global approaches to learning and urged other schools to consider similar approaches. One idea: convening groups of faculty and students on PALAC campuses to work on a single project of global importance. Jeff Warren, vice president academic of Quest University Canada, told alliance members about that institution’s unique curriculum, which doesn’t follow traditional semesters and is largely skills- and experience-based. He also discussed potential future learning projects that build on such an approach within PALAC. Representing another institution with a novel approach, Fulbright University Vietnam, Tran Vinh Linh from the mathematics faculty described how its study programs immerse students fully in Vietnam’s culture and society. The university, which was established in 2016 but does not yet have a campus, is supported by the governments of both Vietnam and the United States. In addition to describing the academic programs at Duke Kunshan University (DKU) and ideas including student exchange programs and workshops for faculty at PALAC institutions, Scott MacEachern addressed some of the challenges DKU—and liberal arts education in general—has faced in China in particular. MacEachern noted that liberal arts institutions, which tend to be elite and private in the U.S., haven’t always had a warm reception among Chinese students and parents, who tend to focus on future job prospects for graduates and specific career paths. Most prestigious schools in China are public, and choosing a liberal arts path presents financial hurdles for families and less possibility to realistically educate a population of China’s size. Nonetheless, participants had no shortage of ideas about specific issues that the alliance might impact positively. A group on global climate change and migration and marginalized communities identified some important synergies between global climate change and the disproportionate impact these changes are having on marginalized communities around the Pacific region. SUA’s George Busenberg, associate professor of environmental management and policy, offered the possibility of a Pacific Environmental Project that would make materials and data on climate change accessible in a reliable, web-based format. Looking forward, the teams identified several key areas for potential PALAC partnerships, including collaborative instruction, such as hackathons focused on solutions to particular programs, and shared online courses that could be done remotely, such as summer programs and research collaborations.

Chowdhury With Inaugural Soka Global Citizen Award", "text": "In honor of the 20th anniversary of its Aliso Viejo campus, Soka University of America is proud to announce Ambassador Anwarul K. Chowdhury as the recipient of the inaugural Soka Global Citizen Award, for his life’s work and achievements for peace, women’s rights and equality, and for the cause of the world’s poorest and most disadvantaged nations. SUA President Ed Feasel, who initiated the award that includes $25,000 to carry on the honored work, noted that Ambassador Chowdhury has served as the under-secretary-general and high representative for least developed countries, landlocked developing countries, and small island developing states, president of the UN Security Council, president of UNICEF, permanent representative to the UN and senior special advisor to the UN General Assembly president. He has received numerous awards including the U Thant Peace Award, UNESCO Gandhi Gold Medal for Culture of Peace, Spirit of the UN Award, University of Massachusetts Boston Chancellor’s Medal for Global Leadership for Peace, 2018 Global Women’s Peace Award, 2020 Robert Muller World Peace Prize for UN Global Peace Leader, and the L’Ordre Nationale from the Burkina Faso government for his championing the cause of landlocked developing countries. In 2003, he received an honorary doctorate from Soka University in Japan for his advocacy for women, children, and the culture of peace. In 2012, he received a Doctor of Humane Letters honoris causa degree from Saint Peter’s University, in Jersey City, NJ. He is a patron of the Committee on Teaching About the UN (CTAUN). He also is a member of the advisory council of the National Peace Academy. Ambassador Chowdhury’s life work has especially contributed to the practice of the culture of peace and nonviolence. Soon after assuming his position as Bangladesh ambassador to the UN, he initiated a proposal in a letter to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan that the United Nations General Assembly develop a specific agenda on the culture of peace. He chaired the negotiations among the member states of UN that culminated in the adoption of the 1999 Landmark Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace. He also initiated the proclamation of the “International Decade for Culture of Peace and Nonviolence for the Children of the World (2001-2010).” Both were adopted by the UN General Assembly. Ambassador Chowdhury is the founder of the New York-based coalition of civil society organizations, Global Movement for The Culture of Peace (GMCoP). In 2020, Ambassador Chowdhury co-authored a book with SUA founder Daisaku Ikeda entitled Creating the Culture of Peace: A Clarion Call for Individual and Collective Transformation . Ambassador Chowdhury has been a strong and widely respected advocate for the equality of women and women’s rights throughout his career. During his tenure as president of the UN Security Council, Ambassador Chowdhury led the initiative in March 2000 that brought about the political and conceptual breakthrough leading to the adoption of the groundbreaking UN Security Council Resolution 1325 in which the council recognized for the first time the role and contribution of women in the area of peace and security as well as the equality of their participation at all decision-making levels. Resolution 1325 urges the increase in participation of women and incorporating gender perspectives in all United Nations peace and security efforts. It also calls on all parties to conflict to take special measures to protect women and girls from gender-based violence, particularly rape and other forms of sexual abuse, in situations of armed conflict. “Without peace, development is impossible, and without development, peace is not achievable,” Chowdhury said, “but without women, neither peace nor development is possible. “If we are serious about peace and development, we must take women seriously.” In his role as under-secretary-general and high representative of the UN for the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing states, Ambassador Chowdhury was also a well-known champion of these most vulnerable countries and tirelessly worked for mobilizing the international community’s support for the countries in the eradication of poverty and in advancing their human development efforts. He asserted forcefully at a United Nations forum that “the world leaders…need to live up to their responsibility to look after those whose needs are the greatest.” Public speaking and advocacy for the culture of peace, women’s equality and global citizenship continue to keep him engaged. Ambassador Chowdhury will be accepting his award during a special virtual celebration of Soka University’s 20th anniversary on May 2 at 5 p.m. PDT. He will be addressing SUA students, staff, faculty, alumni and supporters around the world, sharing his current work for the culture of peace, and women’s equality and empowerment and his message for the students. “I am proud to hold up Ambassador Chowdhury as a role model for our students,” Dr. Feasel said. “He is truly an inspiration for us all. As Soka University celebrates its 20th anniversary, we are honored that our new Global Citizen Award is shining a spotlight on an individual who is using their wisdom, courage, and compassion to lift up others and improve our world. “We’re also excited that we will be hosting the World Summit of Educators and sharing their wisdom with others. SUA’s mission is to foster a steady stream of global citizens committed to living a contributive life—people who will give back to their communities and make this world a better place. We hope our entire 20th anniversary year will inspire others to give back to their communities.”", "categories": ["Soka Global Citizen Award", "Soka at 20", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "March 16, 2021", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Soka’s Office of Admission is adapting to the new reality by leveraging technology to connect with prospective students, parents, and anyone else who wants to learn more about Soka. “The two main challenges,” said Andrew Woolsey, Dean of Enrollment Services, “are finding ways to reach people in order to promote Soka University, and counseling students through the application process.” Admission counselors across the country are having to adjust to not being able to travel to visit high schools and community-based organizations (CBOs) during this admissions cycle. The basic goal hasn’t changed, but now they have to ask how do they use technology to connect creatively? Experience Soka is normally a three-day, two-night event designed to give admitted students a first-hand experience with campus life, classes, students, and faculty. In Spring 2020, Soka was unable to bring students to campus, but still wanted to give them a sense of what the Soka community is like. Instead of merely building a program that mimicked what Experience Soka had been in the past, the Admission team first surveyed admitted students about their needs and interests. The Admission staff learned that they already knew plenty about the institution and its academic offerings. What they wanted most was the opportunity to connect with peers and alumni. So the staff coordinated a series of webinar sessions called, “Soka Stories – An Admitted Student Experience,” which were hosted by current students from different concentrations. Alumni also participated in the online sessions to share their post-grad experience, whether in a career or pursuing higher education. Moving forward, Soka will be providing even more online resources and webinar series to those interested in learning more about the university. Soon, a dynamic virtual tour of the campus will be available, featuring 360° views and images enabling visitors to see what the inside of classrooms and residence halls look like. The Office of Admission will also attend virtual college fairs and continue communicating with high school counselors and CBOs domestically and internationally. Soka has always offered information sessions and one-on-one video appointments, so the focus now is on creating more opportunities for connection. “What we need now more than ever is a growth mindset of hope,” Woolsey said. “Soka is a community that is adaptable and able to persevere through adversity. Coming together is the most important thing that will help us get through this and move forward. The situation is not ideal by any stretch, yet as we strive for excellence, I am very hopeful because I know in my heart there are a lot of great people–students, staff, faculty, administration, and alumni–at our institution. Everyone is helping and trying to make this new reality and world a better place.” —by Nagisa Smalheiser ’21", "categories": ["Admission", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "August 12, 2020", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

{"newspaper": "soka-news", "url": "https://www.soka.edu/news-events/news/innovative-option-next-generation-peacebuilders-and-social-innovators", "title": "An Innovative Option for the Next Generation of Peacebuilders and Social Innovators", "text": "In a time of heightened divisiveness and turmoil in the world, two universities with similar missions have come together to educate the next generation of peacebuilders. Beginning next fall SUA students can start graduate studies at the Joan B. Kroc School of Peace Studies at the University of San Diego while completing their undergraduate degrees. Soka students are encouraged to discuss the program with their academic advisor and program co-director Lisa MacLeod in their second or third year. Students in their third year at SUA should contact Kroc School admissions to learn more about each program and admission requirements. Students may apply at any time prior to the Kroc School’s final application deadlines. Deadlines vary by degree. Once students are formally admitted to the Kroc School, they may petition to take courses from the Kroc School and transfer up to eight units of credit towards their SUA degree. Once they have graduated from SUA, students may petition the Kroc School to transfer up to eight units of SUA credits towards their master’s degree. A maximum of 12 units may count toward both degrees. The Accelerated Bachelor’s to Master’s Degree Program between SUA and the Kroc School—SUA’s second fast-track graduate program—allows students to pursue a master’s degree at an internationally renowned graduate school, whose focus is the education of future peacebuilders. “Having collaborated with colleagues at the Kroc School and USD in the past, I am particularly proud of this new partnership, which brings together two universities whose mission and founding principles are so closely aligned,” said Michael Weiner, vice president for Academic Affairs, interim dean of faculty, and professor of East Asian history and International Studies. “I think this provides our students with a unique opportunity to carry forward the mission of SUA into the real world.” Patricia Márquez, associate provost for academic planning and innovation, dean and professor of social innovation at the Joan B. Kroc School of Peace Studies, echoed Weiner’s enthusiasm. “We are incredibly excited about our new partnership with Soka University of America,” Márquez said. “Through this collaboration we are able to offer students more opportunities for pursuing unique accelerated degree programs focused on peacebuilding, conflict resolution, and changemaking. “Mrs. Joan B. Kroc would be very proud because this is the type of initiative that exemplifies her vision for building a better world through education in peace and justice. The combined programs bring together the strengths of Soka’s liberal arts education with the Kroc School’s unique pedagogical models for learning how to build more peaceful and just societies. We can hardly wait to see the impact the students will have in the world.” Before joining SUA, Weiner had served as chair of the Department of Asian Studies and director of the Japan Studies Institute at San Diego State University. He represented that university on the organizing committee for the annual Kyoto Laureate Symposium at USD. Weiner later invited a colleague from the Kroc School, Necla Tschirgi, distinguished professor of Human Security and Peacebuilding, to participate in the Culture of Peace event at SUA, which has historically brought peacemakers to the Soka campus. In 2020, Professor Tschirgi suggested a meeting with senior USD administrators, who raised the possibility of developing an accelerated BA to master’s program with SUA. Weiner quickly agreed and met with USD colleagues over a period of months. Using Soka’s accelerated graduate degree program with Claremont Graduate University as a template, we designed a program that both schools are thrilled with, Weiner said. Through this arrangement, qualified undergraduates can begin taking courses toward one of three master’s degrees: MA in Peace and Justice, MA in Social Innovation, or MS in Conflict Management and Resolution. Weiner said the three options allow students to narrow their focus on particular paths to careers in peacebuilding, while offering opportunities for them to pursue field work with leading practitioners in the field. The Kroc School will waive the application fee for students in the accelerated program. “We can now offer students an extraordinary gateway into a very specialized world, a school where the entire curriculum is focused on peacebuilding, conflict resolution, and social innovation,” he said. “Soka provides the foundation and then the Kroc School enhances those skills in terms of the real world, preparing our students to pursue that mission and in a concrete way.

{"newspaper": "soka-news", "url": "https://www.soka.edu/news-events/news/challenging-new-students-consider-humanitys-enduring-questions", "title": "Challenging New Students to Consider Humanity's Enduring Questions", "text": "It is one of SUA’s signature experiences, a rigorous introduction to university-level intellectual work during which first-year students delve into the works of some of humanity’s most profound thinkers and grapple with life’s most vexing questions. Core 1 is a three-week, intensive seminar that both faculty and students describe as a consuming, eye-opening, and rewarding experience. With each section limited to 12 students, faculty members from across disciplines guide students through selections from seminal texts from around the globe. Professors choose readings from works such as Confucius’ The Analects , Plato’s Republic , Laozi’s Tao Te Ching , and Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics , and may augment those with additional works drawn from their own expertise. The goals of the Core sequence—Core 1 is followed by Core 2 in the spring of students’ second year—are ambitious. Classes are designed to help students explore the commonalities and differences of the human experience from multiple perspectives, and develop critical thinking skills to evaluate ideas in relation to their own lives. “Core is a point of departure, helping a student take a pen and begin to draw a map of the world of thought, find themselves on that map, and find others in relation to themselves,” said John Pavel Kehlen, professor of Asian literature, who has been teaching Core sections since 2003. “We don’t pretend we will get answers, but asking the questions is the first step to what I call becoming a liberal artist.” In the early stages of planning the Core program before the Aliso Viejo campus opened in 2001, SUA faculty members came up with a list of essential texts. Michael D. Golden, professor of Music Theory and Composition, said the works were chosen primarily because they “arguably had extensive influence across time and space, and so became part of the canon—things an ‘educated person should know about.’ ” Prof. Golden said although he doesn’t necessarily disagree with that assessment, his own repeated readings of the texts and studying them with students through the years has altered how he teaches the class. “I have come to believe that it is more important for us to strive to learn something about the nature and meaning of human life from the enduring questions themselves, and perhaps even more from the creative and diverse ways in which humans everywhere have attempted to answer them over the millenia,” Prof. Golden said. Alongside the Torah, the Upanishads, Plato, and Confucius, he now includes and gives equal weight in the course to Indigenous sources. “In other words, all of these texts are myths—human attempts to answer questions that remain ultimately unanswerable,” said Prof. Golden. Gathering around the seminar table to share different perspectives on tough questions was particularly gratifying this semester, said Prof. Kehlen, as students’ responses were filtered through their experience of the pandemic and the tumultuous events of the past few years. While the texts students read and discuss are ancient, the questions they pose remain necessary and provocative. Plato’s pondering the answer to the question, “What is justice?” is one example that students could easily connect to current events, said Kehlen. Maya Hidana ’25 agreed that the readings were timely. “Although we were often studying very ancient, crusty texts, our Core teacher did a great job of helping us connect these readings to the here and now,” she said. Both students and faculty agree that Core is an intense experience. “The lack of sleep during the first Core class has become legendary,” jokes Prof. Golden, who said part of the intensity comes “from the challenge of pursuing wisdom as opposed to just acquiring knowledge.” When students say they are frustrated by the difficult questions they’re discussing, Prof. Kehlen said he reassures them they are not alone—and the struggle is worth it. “I’ve been reading these works for 30 years and learn something each time,” he said. “Some of the most interesting and joyful conversations I’ve had come from teaching Core. I am absolutely another student at the table.” For many students, the volume of reading required during Core was the most challenging aspect of the program. Some of those readings made an especially strong impression. Solar Kawabata ’25, said that Laozi’s Tao Te Ching had the greatest impact on his thinking, especially his concept of “effortless effort.” “The way I interpret this is that the effort you make should feel natural,” said Kawabata. “It’s difficult, but I’m trying to apply this to everything I do so that I feel more grounded in my own confidence and sense of self.” What might have been one of the most difficult topics to discuss—death—deeply affected Naylah Oliveira Santos ’25. “I feel that confronting the question of death more deeply really made me want to keep growing and not take a single moment here for granted,” she said. She named the Essays of Montaigne as the book that made the strongest impression on her during the course. “Montaigne writes about how we are always fearing death, and that we don’t know if it’s an end or a new beginning,” she said. “When death comes, we need to be prepared. We need to be happy with the life we’ve lived.” One purpose of Core is to prompt students to begin reflecting on the concept and reality of becoming global citizens. The class did so successfully, said Devin Weber ’25. “We compared different ideas about goodness, justice, and understanding oneself,” said Weber. “I also gained an understanding of what my fellow classmates think. Here’s what global citizenship means to me now: there are certain sets of paradigms that guide societies around the world. However, there is no one set that is the absolute correct set of paradigms. Each has drawbacks and benefits. Global citizenship involves learning from each one to create something new that benefits people around the world.” Olveira Santos said the perspectives of both East and West were alive in classroom discussions. “Hearing all of the different perspectives from classmates around the world and reading about these two major philosophical traditions has definitely shaped my thinking about what it means to be a global citizen,” she said. Hidana said the program succeeded in transforming her notion of what it means to become a global citizen. “I thought global citizenship meant being free of restrictions and free to travel around the world,” said Hidana. “Now, after Core 1, I believe global citizenship is a proactive, engaged, and contributive way of life. I feel this burning need to do something—to contribute something to the world.” Despite how difficult Core 1 can be for students at the time, faculty say students often tell them years later how much they appreciated, and learned, from the class. “Examining the enduring questions and the answers that our lives have been based on up until now can shake us up, broaden our perspective, and provoke fresh thinking and reflection,” said Prof. Golden. “And that, it seems to me, is the best possible introduction to university education.”", "categories": ["Undergraduate Academics", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "November 09, 2021", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

{"newspaper": "soka-news", "url": "https://www.soka.edu/news-events/news/michael-sasaki-05-wins-best-short-film-malaga-film-festival", "title": "Michael Sasaki ’05 Wins Best Short Film at Málaga Film Festival", "text": "Shortly after his mother died, Michael Sasaki ’05 received a package from Japan. He opened the box, removed his mother’s kimono, put it on, picked up her Japanese hand fan, and began dancing. “My connection with my mom was so powerful as I danced the traditional style of Japanese Nihon-buyō dance she’d practiced and loved so much,” Sasaki said. “I knew immediately that I had to express the power of this moment.” Six years later, the culmination of Sasaki’s quest to express this moment is resonating with audiences worldwide. Masaru , a short film inspired by Sasaki’s mother, recently won the Best Short Film at the renowned Málaga Film Festival in Spain. Masaru centers on a Major League Baseball player who discovers his passion for Japanese traditional dance and must choose between embracing his true identity or resigning himself to the pressures of family, loyalty, and honor. The road to filming Masaru was filled with stops and starts. Sasaki began acting in 2008 not long after his 2005 graduation from Soka. In 2010, he took a break from acting and went back out on the road as a figure skater. After retiring from show skating, he settled in Los Angeles in 2016. Later that year, his mother and father died from cancer within five months of each other. “At that moment,” Sasaki said, “I realized how short life is and began asking myself an important question: ‘If you could do something for free for the rest of your life, what would it be?’” The answer was clear: acting and making movies. Not just any movies though. As an SUA alumnus, Sasaki wants to be involved in projects that are transformative rather than just “mainstream” entertainment. “Through film, I want to tell the stories of the voiceless, of minorities whose stories are not frequently told,” Sasaki said. Sasaki wrote the script for Masaru , which is based on events in his life, during the first summer of the global pandemic. He took Japanese dancing lessons as a kid, and his mother was a talented Japanese Nihon-buyō dancer. Though not identical to his father, the father in the film represents the traditional views of gender roles held by many Japanese men. Linda Harada, Mrs. Sasaki’s former dance instructor, plays Iwamoto Sensei, the titular character’s dance teacher in the film. Though she had no acting experience, Sasaki said, Harada graciously gave acting a try. The echoes and resonances of these real-life connections and histories imbue the film with a depth of feeling that belies its short 12-minute running time. As often happens on film sets, some creative tug of war occurred during the early production of Masaru . As filming neared, people from different departments offered critical feedback on the original script. While some of it was difficult to hear because of the film’s autobiographical roots, Sasaki realized the critiques were not personal; rather, they were motivated by their desire to ensure the success of the film. Sasaki saw that some of his team was beginning to shut down at the crucial moment of disagreement. He took swift action, engaging in dialogue with every producer and uniting the team at the moment when pre-production could have collapsed. “I was reminded by this experience that it requires this kind of death-defying dialogue to make sure people aren’t just smiling, but rather are truly united and engaged,” Sasaki said. “And by ‘dialogue,’ I’m not talking about just chatting. I mean really challenging people.” Sasaki’s ethos as a filmmaker can be traced, in part, back to his study abroad experience at Soka. Living in Spain for half a year enabled him to step outside his own narrow vision and realize that people have their own distinct stories like his—albeit refracted through a different cultural lens. Navigating these new, unfamiliar rhythms of language and custom, Sasaki realized there is something people share in the essence of their varied experiences. “‘ I want to be happy. I want to express myself. ’ Studying abroad showed me that beyond cultural borders, people everywhere yearn for such things.” His experience abroad was further enriched by the diversity of living on campus at SUA, which Sasaki remembers as its own kind of on-campus study abroad experience in which one learns to creatively co-exist with and grow from encounters with other cultures. “I believe that’s what Soka founder Daisaku Ikeda has tried to instill in students from the very first class: respect for all people regardless of our differences,” Sasaki said. Masaru ’s victory in the Best Short Film category at the Málaga Film Festival is a moment of coming full circle: Sasaki’s first major award as an artist happens to be from the country where he studied abroad and began thinking seriously about the meaning of global citizenship. The Málaga Film Festival is one of the most prestigious film festivals in the Spanish-speaking world and is celebrated in several venues around Málaga, including the Picasso Museum and the University of Málaga. Sasaki is in the early stages of turning Masaru into a feature-length film. He originally intended Masaru to be a feature, but as a first-time filmmaker, he decided to start with a short film and lay the foundation for a feature-length film in the future. He recently debuted as the lead in the play Masao and the Bronze Nightingale at the Casa 0101 theater in Boyle Heights, Los Angeles.

The Western Association of Schools and Colleges – Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC) accredits public and private higher education institutions in the United States and around the world, focusing primarily on those in California, Hawaii, and the Pacific Islands region. Through a process of peer review, the commission encourages continuous institutional improvement and ensures that accredited institutions are fulfilling their missions in service to their students and the public good. “WSCUC Commissioners perform a valuable service to students, higher education, and accreditation,” said Jamienne S. Studley, president of WSCUC, in making the announcement. “We are truly grateful that you have agreed to undertake this responsibility, especially given what a pivotal time this is for assuring confidence in accreditation and the value of postsecondary education.” Asawa, whose three-year term begins July 1, said he was “honored and excited” to serve on the commission. Tomoko Takahashi, vice president for institutional research and assessment and dean of the Graduate School, previously served as a WSCUC commissioner and spearheaded Soka’s accreditation review process. “It presents an opportunity for me to further contribute back to our field of higher education,” Asawa said. “Being among university presidents, provosts, and other senior-level college administrators on the commission, I will do my best to represent Soka during my WSCUC term.” In 2021, WSCUC approved SUA’s accreditation for another 10 years, using a new streamlined process designed for high-performing institutions that demonstrate consistent evidence of healthy fiscal condition, strong student achievement indicators, and sustained quality performance. SUA received its first accreditation in June 2005, four years ahead of what is typical for a new institution.", "categories": ["Campus News"], "date_publish": "May 10, 2022", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Ambassador Young traveled from Atlanta, Ga., to accept the award during a ceremony attended by more than 100 students, faculty, and staff in the Founder’s Meeting Room. “I come to you today saying, yes, the world’s in a tough state now,” Ambassador Young said, “but looking at it from the point of view of the saints I’ve known, I’m still optimistic about our future.” Ambassador Young has received numerous awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, France’s Légion d’honneur, the NAACP Spingarn Medal, and more than 45 honorary degrees. Perhaps best known for his leadership in the civil rights movement—serving as Martin Luther King Jr.’s close advisor and executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference—Ambassador Young has shaped policy and peacemaking on the global stage. He recently established the International University of Grand-Bassam in Cote d’Ivoire, Africa, a scholarship program for students attending Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and is working on various television documentaries and global health and healing projects. During his welcoming remarks, President Edward Feasel praised Ambassador Young as an exemplary global citizen who embodies the spirit of the Global Citizen Award. “We are truly honored to have Ambassador Andrew Young with us today as the second recipient of our university’s prestigious award,” President Feasel said. “We honor him today for his numerous achievements as a transformational leader in the nation and world, and his lifelong dedication to peacebuilding, human rights, and the freedom of all people.” The Soka Global Citizen Award recognizes an individual for efforts, either throughout their life or for a major event or initiative, that embodies the essential elements of global citizenship as articulated by SUA founder Daisaku Ikeda in his 1996 address at Teachers College, Columbia University. The award criteria during the selection process stipulates that all nominees should have made a major contribution to the global community and effected positive change in one of the following areas: Ambassador Young is the award’s second recipient. The inaugural winner was Ambassador Anwarul K. Chowdhury, the former Bangladesh ambassador to the United Nations who was honored for his life’s work and achievements for peace and women’s rights. The annual prize carries an award of $25,000 to further the recipient’s work. In his acceptance address, Ambassador Young reflected that in his many years of traveling internationally to build bridges between peoples and nations, there is no place he’s been where he didn’t meet someone whom he couldn’t look up to and see as the hope of their nation. Despite the chaotic state of the world in 2022, his message to the Soka students in attendance was resolutely hopeful. “Don’t ever give up on peace,” Ambassador Young said. “Don’t ever give up on humanity. Don’t ever give up on the eternal spirit that moves through and among us.”", "categories": ["Soka Global Citizen Award", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "May 12, 2022", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

The atmosphere at the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia was electric as undergraduate-, graduate-, and postdoctoral-level students presented research and mingled with leading scientists in various fields. Koyama presented her research on yeast genes whose function was previously unknown. In the fall of 2020, Life Sciences students at Soka were unable to work in the lab due to the pandemic. Prof. Walsh created a project that could be completed remotely on students’ computers. Koyama’s work integrated bioinformatics, cell biology, and biochemistry to determine the then unknown function of a yeast protein, and she continued her research the following summer when Soka reopened. “I learned from my project that unsuccessful experiments are just a daily part of life for scientists and researchers,” said Koyama, “so even if things do not work, just don’t feel down about it. Sometimes they can help you better understand your research.” Nguyen, who is interested in molecular biology, appreciated the accessible way presenters explained complex research. She especially enjoyed studying posters, which summarized research conducted by fellow undergraduates. Mingling with peers and learning about their work strengthened her motivation to continue pursuing scientific research. “I really enjoy immersing myself in this community where people are so passionate about research,” Nguyen said. Koyama and Nguyen said they appreciated the opportunity to learn about branches of biology they’d never encountered and to interact with scientists from prestigious institutions, biotech companies, NASA, and the National Institutes of Health. They both felt they were treated as fellow scientists throughout the conference. “If you are hoping to go to graduate school to study science,” Walsh said, “it’s really important to have a chance to present alongside graduate students, postdocs, and faculty and see what this world is like.” —Nugnandini Chhetri ’25", "categories": ["Research", "Life Sciences", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "June 13, 2022", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Typically done during fourth year, the project requires students to become intimately familiar with a topic of their choice and write a dissertation. Students first enroll in the Capstone 390 course for a semester, picking a mentor from the SUA faculty to help guide them through their project or to plan their project proposal. They then enroll in Capstone 400 and 450 as they conduct research and begin writing. The Capstone Experience gives students the opportunity to grow as writers and critical thinkers. Students may investigate any subject as long as it relates to their concentration, encouraging interdisciplinary study. All students are potentially eligible for grants, furthering the possibilities for research. The breadth and depth of capstone projects are vast, giving students the freedom to pursue topics they are passionate about. For Skyler Wolf ’22, capstone was an opportunity to blend their passion for horror films and Japanese culture. Wolf decided to examine the genre of Japanese horror films through a feminist lens after taking Professor John Kehlen’s courses on world cinema and Japanese cinema. “It was immediately apparent to me that discussion of gender is not a side piece of Japanese horror films—it is the core content of horror, from the very beginning,” Wolf said of their capstone “‘This is the Happiness of Being a Woman’: the Representation of Womanhood in a Century of Japanese Horror Film.” By evaluating the films in the context of gendered power relations, Wolf has defied the assumption of many film critics that the genre does not warrant deep analysis. “Ultimately, what I’ve come to realize is that it’s so important to look at these areas of movies, literature, art,” Wolf said, “…that people have said are worthless and just don’t meet the standard of ‘high art’.” Wolf’s capstone project has directly affected their life trajectory. After graduating, they will attend the University of British Columbia to continue Japanese language studies. They plan to obtain a Master’s in Asian Studies and study in Yokohama, Japan in the second year of the program to improve their language skills. Bijesh Thapa ‘22 also integrated capstone research into their future plans. Thapa, who is interested in becoming a market analyst, studied the US banking industry for their capstone, “Post-Merger Asset Returns in the US Banking Industry.” Noting that the top four banks in the US now control approximately 60% of the country’s total banking assets, Thapa investigated how the industry arrived at its current state and the effects of mergers on the assets of large banks. Thapa analyzed the Federal Reserve Board’s database for the banks’ asset data and a government document used to approve bank mergers and acquisitions. “These four banks basically direct the whole industry,” Thapa said. “And we could come up with better legislation for regulating the mergers…mergers do not necessarily lead to better cost-effectiveness.” Thapa grew familiar with the market economy when they worked as a stock broker for their grandmother in their home country of Nepal. They became interested in the similarities and differences between the banking systems of Nepal and the US. Thapa claims that unlike Nepal, large banks in the US have a significant influence on the international economy, making their share in assets carry even more weight. Another student invested in the global impacts of their field of inquiry is Saanika Joshi ’23, who chose to write about women’s healthcare. Joshi, one of several third-year students who started their capstone project a semester early, enrolled in Capstone 390 so they could study abroad during the fall semester of their fourth year. As a self-identified woman and aspiring doctor, they have a strong desire to highlight the experiences of women. “The goal is…inspiring change even locally as I move forward, fostering a better environment for care, and also looking at the intersectionality of this particular topic in women’s health,” Joshi said. “It’s a completely different kind of care. And it’s a new kind of medicine.” At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Joshi observed that many women expressed their oftentimes traumatic healthcare experiences online. They plan to use social media content and interview physicians about women’s health to examine the biases and discrimination that pervade the healthcare system. Joshi believes that by doing this research, they will better understand their motivations for becoming a doctor while also raising awareness about important social issues in healthcare. What sets capstone apart from senior-year projects at other universities is the close mentor-mentee relationship. Soka’s 7:1 student-to-faculty ratio allows for a high degree of individualization. By working directly with faculty members, students can make connections that last beyond their time at the university. All of the interviewees agreed that their mentors were crucial to not only their dissertations, but their personal success. “Dr. Kevin Moncrief has inspired me tremendously by his work, by his character, [and] by his interests,” Thapa said. Reflecting on their work with Professor Kehlen, Wolf said, “He’s given me so much personal and life advice that I really treasure. And I know that John Kehlen is the type of mentor [who] does not stop mentoring me when I leave Soka.” —Isa Queano ’23", "categories": ["Undergraduate Program - BA", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "June 14, 2022", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

In his annual peace proposal in 1987—the same year SUA founder Daisaku Ikeda acknowledged that a well-coordinated response to the interconnected global issues facing humanity demanded creativity, collective wisdom, and efforts that transcended regional barriers—he called for the establishment of a center that would be “part of a network of research centers, universities, and United Nations study facilities from which a strategy for world stability and peace for the 21st century can emerge.” Andrea Bartoli, president of the Sant’Egidio Foundation for Peace and Dialogue and a member of SUA’s Board of Trustees, has been named the institute’s first executive advisor, with Tetsushi Ogata, visiting assistant professor of peace and conflict studies at SUA, and Yuya Uchida, manager of overseas development, named as managing director and coordinator. In a message to the community, President Edward Feasel outlined the following objectives that will guide the institute’s priorities: Based on these overarching objectives, the institute will launch two projects in 2022. The first is a K-12 academic curriculum that consolidates a global citizenship educational framework. The curriculum will be designed by a working group of SUA alumni who are currently teaching in the US and internationally. The second project will bring together SUA alumni involved in nonproliferation and nuclear disarmament. They will collaborate with experts and researchers from academia, civil society, and faith organizations toward the elimination of nuclear weapons. President Feasel expressed confidence the institute will over time become a powerful force in overcoming the global challenges and existential threats confronting humanity. “Our alumni will play a critical role in helping us accomplish this,” President Feasel said. “I am especially grateful to Dr. Andrea Bartoli for his effective, creative leadership and advice to the institute as we launch our first projects.” In addition to serving as executive advisor of the institute, Bartoli has played a key role in successful diplomacy and peacemaking processes in countries around the world. As an international conflict resolution expert, Bartoli has held distinguished academic positions directing centers and schools at Columbia, George Mason, and Seton Hall universities. Excited by the opportunity to discover new possibilities for networks through the institute’s work, Bartoli reiterated his belief that no global solution can be imagined and implemented if not through networks. “This new role of executive advisor of the Soka Institute for Global Solutions is an important one,” Bartoli said, “because it brings together worlds that are very different. I think that the impact will be connected to the commitment of so many alumni of Soka University of America that have already expressed interest. I am excited to work with Dr. Ogata and Mr. Uchida and definitely eager for this new adventure.” Ogata acknowledged that the scope of the realities the institute plans to tackle can often give rise to a sense of powerlessness. However, “because the task is so daunting,” he said, “that is precisely why SUA and its alumni need to step up and make tangible changes in our society. For what purpose does ‘global citizenship’ exist, if not for making actual changes in society?”", "categories": ["Campus News"], "date_publish": "June 14, 2022", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

With the theme of “Tributes to Women: Equality, Equity, and Empowerment,” the three-event series kicked off with a talk by Tanya Henderson, the international human rights lawyer and founder of Mina’s List; a women’s circle that brought female-identifying campus community members together to reflect and connect; and a panel discussion where SUA women shared their personal experiences navigating issues of gender and identity. The aim was to build relationships across campus and increase the number of people committed to actualizing equality and equity, said Maya Gunaseharan, manager for diversity initiatives and community building, whose office organized the series alongside the university’s gender equity working group. “We hope that this moment becomes one where each of us identifies actions we can take to be a catalyst for gender equity, equality, and empowerment.” A leader in promoting women’s rights, peace and security, and women’s political participation around the globe, Henderson opened her March 8 talk by describing the resonance she felt with SUA founder Daisaku Ikeda’s ideas and the essential role of education and human rights in promoting peace. “Throughout history, women’s rights movements have also worked to advance larger collective goals of peace and social justice,” Henderson said, “recognizing that peace and respect for the dignity of life is the foundation of everything.” Henderson noted that the founding of International Women’s Day in the early 1900s was similarly rooted in women’s activism to advance peace and justice, with members of Socialist parties in the United States and Europe proposing its establishment as a strategy to promote equal rights and women’s suffrage. More recently, women’s “courageous activism” has spurred revolutions around the world, including in Egypt, Yemen, Libya, and Liberia, where the Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace movement led by Nobel Peace Laureate Leymah Gbowee brought together 3,000 Christian and Muslim women to stage nonviolent protests to help end Liberia’s 14-year civil war. Their actions eventually led to the rise of Liberia’s first female head of state, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. “Research has consistently shown that electing more women to government leads to increased protection of women’s rights and greater gender equality,” she said. Henderson said the importance of putting more women in political leadership around the world led her to launch Mina’s List in 2014. But she hadn’t anticipated the setbacks women would face, notably in Afghanistan, where Mina’s List’s efforts have included helping to evacuate women leaders who were endangered as the Taliban took control of the country. “Over and over again, the women leaders would say to me, ‘20 years of our work for women’s rights and peace are now all lost,’” Henderson said. “What I have learned most astutely from this experience is that nothing is more important than peace.” The focus turned from global to local two days later, when women from all parts of the SUA community—students, faculty, and staff—gathered in the Athenaeum for an intimate conversation. A women’s circle, Gunaseharan said, seemed an ideal way to connect SUA women who might not otherwise spend time together and to provide a safe and supportive environment where they could reflect and openly discuss their individual experiences. About 20 women joined the discussion, led by Michelle Hobby-Mears, associate dean of students and director of student activities, which touched on navigating issues of gender, identity, and societal and cultural roles. Those same topics were at the heart of the panel discussion that closed out the event series on March 31. Representatives from various areas of campus life reflected on how gender impacts the other identities they hold; the messages they received in childhood around gender and those they wished they’d heard; and who they look to in their own lives as advocates of gender equality. Erica Baldaray, assistant director of athletics, said the lack of women’s leaders in sports when she was growing up spurred her to become one. “Being a woman has fueled me to be a leader in sports,” she said. “I didn’t see women in coaching positions or as athletic directors, and if I did, it was an anomaly. I wanted to be that representation for the next generation of women. Awareness of my responsibility as a woman pushed me to be the best that I’m capable of being and to set up a path for women in leadership in sports.” Associate Professor of Economics Diya Mazumder commented on the effort it takes for women to resist the messages that limit them and forge their own paths and identities. “To be our authentic selves takes a lot of work,” she said. The panelists agreed on the importance of replacing ideas of competition with “lifting each other up as we rise,” Baldaray said. “For so long we were fighting for that one seat at the table, but the more we can celebrate one another’s successes, support one another, and bring others along with us, the better we succeed.” Mazumder encouraged the women in the audience to expand their ideas about supporting other women and to fight the common habit of remaining isolated in their personal struggles. “Check in with other women regularly and ask them what they need and what you can do,” she said. As the month drew to a close, Gunaseharan said much of the feedback she heard from attendees of the three events reflected her own experience of feeling uplifted and inspired. “It is easy in the context of doing equity and inclusion work to feel we are moving at a snail’s pace or that things will never change, but then you witness the power of women—from Tanya Henderson to those in every corner of this institution—and feel so much hope and confidence in the future.”", "categories": ["Women of Soka", "Campus News"], "date_publish": "May 10, 2022", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},
{"newspaper": "soka-news", "url": "https://www.soka.edu/news-events/news/alternative-spring-break-tackling-global-issue-close-home", "title": "Alternative Spring Break: Tackling a Global Issue Close to Home", "text": "This academic year, Soka students who wanted to volunteer during spring break didn’t travel to far-flung locations. They stayed much closer to home. After months of learning about social justice and the issues around resettlement, students taking part in Alternative Spring Break (ASB) worked with the Tiyya Foundation to assist refugee families and communities in Los Angeles and Orange County. In the years since a group of Soka students headed to New Orleans to join the disaster relief efforts after Hurricane Katrina, ASB has become a SUA tradition. It has developed into a co-curricular service-learning program that combines dialogue-based learning with volunteer service with various organizations. The decision to focus on local groups came after numerous discussions about the goals of the program and a shift toward a more clearly defined social justice model, said Ruby Nagashima, assistant director of student leadership and service engagement. “Developing a social justice model raised some questions, including how travel affects the impact students can make, and how much of a sustainable connection can be made far from campus,” said Nagashima, who began leading the program in 2019 after working on SUA’s residential life staff. “With a local organization, students can continue volunteering beyond just a week and SUA can develop more lasting relationships and partnerships with its community.” Keeping the number of students accepted to ASB under 20—in previous years the group had swelled to more than 40—also supported the program’s tighter focus on social justice. A smaller number of students makes it easier to build trust and relationships among the students as they discuss issues around identity and other social justice topics, said Nagashima. Once those decisions were made, Nagashima began reaching out to organizations in the area. She’d become aware of Tiyya a few years ago and connected with its co-founder, Meymuna Hussein-Cattan, on LinkedIn. Dima and her daughter, Meymuna Hussein-Cattan, started the organization to provide the support they had needed as refugees from East Africa. Tiyya aims to build a network of support, including organizing access to economic opportunities and critical resources for immigrants, refugees, and displaced Indigenous communities. During the pandemic, Tiyya also launched Flavors from Afar, a catering business and restaurant in the Little Ethiopia neighborhood of Los Angeles. The social enterprise serves a menu created by a refugee chef and trains other refugee chefs. After discussing ASB with Tiyya’s co-founders, Nagashima said they agreed the program would mutually benefit SUA’s students and the organization. An important component for Nagashima was deepening the ties between SUA and the organization, which included asking Tiyya’s founder and staff to lead some of the seminars students take throughout the academic year as part of ASB, providing context about its work. They designed the program to have students work directly with people the organization supports and also assist with the operational, nuts-and-bolts work that is necessary to fulfill a nonprofit’s mission. “With behind-the-scenes work, they don’t get the appreciation personally, but sometimes it is more important for the organization than direct service,” said Nagashima. In March, students headed to Tiyya’s offices to get to work. They wrapped donations and organized the delivery of toys, diapers, and other items to families; researched and created a local resource map; canvassed for job opportunities; and assisted with job placements. Siena Taylor ’25 said the experience sharpened her awareness of the range of challenges refugees face in Southern California and around the world, including racism, discrimination, financial problems, PTSD, language barriers, and lack of education and job opportunities. Working with Tiyya in different capacities also expanded her understanding of volunteering as part of global citizenship. “I was given the opportunity to explore direct service, research, advocacy, and education, which, in turn, pushed me to reframe how I view global-mindedness,” Taylor said. “Now I realize we can understand and support each other in a variety of ways.” Saki Azuma ’24 agreed that her perspective on volunteering evolved during ASB. “My stance changed from ‘working for them’ to ‘working with them’,” Azuma said. “I was reminded how the people resettling are more than capable of taking care of themselves and contributing to society, they just need support and the connections to assist them in getting the resources they need to start their new life here. I definitely became more aware of the importance of always being willing to learn and also, unlearn our own biases.”", "categories": ["Campus News"], "date_publish": "May 13, 2022", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Presenters from North America, Europe, Asia, South American, and Africa led dozens of lectures during the event, discussing topics including educational equity, Freirean approaches to fostering intercultural understanding, and employing ecopedagogy to encourage sustainability. Several talks that featured SUA faculty, administrators, and alumni highlighted connections between Soka education and Freirean approaches to education. As a result, Freirian scholars from around the world also were introduced to SUA and its founder’s complementary ideals, said Professor Jay Heffron, director of the MA program in Educational Leadership and Societal Change at Soka. Prof. Heffron moderated a panel, “The Hope-Filled Philosophies of Paulo Freire and SUA Founder, Daisaku Ikeda: The Hope of Today Toward the Advancement of World Peace,” with presenters whose papers integrated Freirian ideals around democracy, citizenship, and sustainability with SUA’s mission of educating global citizens. Panelists included Kevin Moncrief, SUA’s vice president for mission integration; Gonzalo Obeillero ’05, instructional assistant professor of curriculum studies at DePaul University; and Monte Joffee, co-founder and former principal of the Soka-based Renaissance Charter School in Queens, New York. In the closing keynote address, “Paulo Freire, Daisaku Ikeda, and the Soka Heritage of Education: Pedagogies of Hope, Joy, and Human Becoming,” Jason Goulah of the DePaul University Institute for Daisaku Ikeda Studies in Education highlighted multiple convergences in the educational philosophies of Freire and Ikeda. Defining this convergence as an East-West pedagogical ecology of determined hope, joy, and human becoming, Goulah argued that the liberatory nature of critical consciousness, inspired by Freire’s Christian socialism, and Ikeda’s Lotus Sutra-centric perspectives on liberatory enlightenment and existential happiness are resonant approaches of unlimited possibility and action in a complex and interconnected world.", "categories": ["Campus News"], "date_publish": "June 15, 2022", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},

Co-sponsored by the government of Ireland and the Council on International Educational Exchange (CIEE), a nonprofit study abroad and intercultural exchange organization, the four-week leadership program for students of color focuses on peacebuilding, conflict resolution, and social justice. “Considering the historical and ongoing impacts of racial discrimination—not just in the US, but around the world—it’s such an honor and privilege to learn from the legacy of Frederick Douglass, who risked his life to fight for the rights of Black people in America,” Okuda said. Okuda was selected as a Frederick Douglass Global Fellow “because of his academic excellence, communication skills, and commitment to social justice,” according to the CIEE. His role as a founding member of the nonprofit Artpeace and completion of the prestigious Humanitarian Affairs Asia Internship were cited as factors that influenced the panel’s selection. CIEE launched the Frederick Douglass Global Fellowship in 2017 to bolster access to study abroad for students from underrepresented groups. This year’s fellowship marks the 175th anniversary of Frederick Douglass’ meeting in Dublin with the Irish reformer Daniel O’Connell. During the four-week program, the fellows will live in Ireland and learn from the towering examples of Douglass and O’Connell while deepening their understanding of peace and conflict resolution. Okuda is eager to learn about historical examples of violent conflicts that were mediated peacefully and believes that Ireland, with its history of protracted sectarian conflict, is the perfect place to engage in such study. When asked if the fellowship had taken on greater urgency because of the war between Russia and Ukraine, Mark didn’t hesitate: “It absolutely has. It’s hard for me to comprehend, let alone figure out what I can do, but by participating in this fellowship program, I want to go from asking, ‘What can I do?’ to “This is what I will do.’”", "categories": ["Campus News"], "date_publish": "April 22, 2022", "date_scrape": "2023-06-02 13:25"},
